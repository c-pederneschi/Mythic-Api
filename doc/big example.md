Let’s do one more Big Example! As in the 
previous chapter, this example will use italicized 
text to describe the role-played story and regular 
text to explain what the Player is doing.

For this example, 
the Player is using 
Mythic with their 
favorite superheroes 
RPG, Superbreakers! 
The game features 
colorful superhero 
action set in a 
universe much like 
our own, except 
that super powers, 
advanced science, and 
alien incursions are an 
every day norm.
The Player has a Character ready to go: 
Rapid Red, a speedster hero who can move 
supersonically fast. This is the Player’s first 
adventure using this hero, so there is no history 
going in. The Player has a blank copy of the 
Adventure Journal and Adventure Lists.
To generate the first Scene the Player decides to 
create a Random Event. Rolling on the Random 
Event Focus Table they get “New NPC”. To get 
some idea what this Character is doing the Player 
rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables and gets 
“Triumph” and “Cooperation”.
The Player interprets the Meaning words as a 
group of superheroes who are tackling a problem. 
Since this Event is about establishing a new NPC, 
the Player decides it means this group is a team.
The Player wants to know what kind of 
problem the team is taking on. Whatever it is, it’s
probably what attracts Rapid Red as well, where 
he runs into the team.
The Player considers framing this as a Fate 
Question, but rather than guessing what the 
problem is they choose to go directly to a Meaning 
Table for inspiration. Rolling on the Actions 
Meaning Tables, they get “Strange” and “Outside”

CHOICES, CHOICES
This example runs through a few Scenes of a 
Player starting a new adventure. Various Mythic 
rules are used in the example, including asking 
Fate Questions and Discovering Meaning by 
getting details from Meaning Tables.
One thing to keep in mind when reading this 
playthrough are the times the Player chooses to 
get a prompt from Mythic, and when they choose 
not to. Everyone is going to play their solo games 
differently, so there is no rule dictating when 
you must ask a Question or get a prompt for a 
detail. The decision is yours for when you want 
to rely on your expectations, creating details 
through improvisation, and when to stop and get 
a prompt from Mythic.
The Player also makes use of the Elements 
Meaning Tables for some details. Once again, 
choosing an Elements Table, and which Table you 
choose, is up to you. There are multiple tables 
that can serve the same purpose, including just 
using the core Actions and Descriptions Tables. 
Personal preference and gut feeling is your friend 
here. There is no wrong choice, especially if you 
are enjoying the end result

Thinking about this a moment the Player 
interprets this to mean there is a strange 
disturbance in the center of the city. Some kind 
of rip in the reality of space has opened, letting 
energies from outside our world in that are 
wreaking havoc.
When not saving people and fighting villains, 
Rapid Red is Rick Burgundy, a reporter for 
the internet news site The Blurb. He’s working 
at their downtown offices when news of the 
disturbances start getting called in. No one needs 
to be informed, however, as just looking out their 
high rise windows shows the chaos below.
Since Rapid works downtown the Player 
wondered if he might be close enough to the 
disturbances to see them. The Player asks a Fate 
Question, “Can he see what’s going on?” The Player 
gives this Odds of Likely, and Mythic says Yes.
To interpret what the PC actually sees, the 
Player considers Discovering Meaning again. 
However, they already know that something 
strange is going on and it involves rifts in reality 
and another dimension leaking into our world. 
The Player decides to run with what they expect 
this to look like rather than get another prompt.

Looking out the window, Rick can see weird 
strands of blue energy snaking between buildings. 
Everything the strands touch wavers and warps, 
as if reality itself were uncertain what it should 
be. Sirens, car horns, and people screaming can 
be heard.

It’s time for Rick to leap into action and help 
save people! The Player’s expectation is that Rick 
has exited work many times before in order to 
act as Rapid Red, so there is no need to ask a 
Question to see if he has any trouble getting away.
The Player considers if this should be the end 
of the first Scene. However, it doesn’t feel quite 
complete yet without Rapid getting to the site of 
the disturbance first.

Making a few quick excuses at the office, Rapid 
zooms down the stairwell, changing into his
superhero uniform before he reaches the street. 
Moving in the blink of an eye he runs to the 
center of the ruckus

Even though this is this Player’s first 
adventure with this Character, and this is the 
first Scene, decisions the Player is making are 
already building Context for the adventure.
Rapid Red works in a downtown office 
building. He is experienced with leaving 
work unnoticed when hero duty calls.
These are small but important details. Every 
detail created in an adventure, whether it’s 
derived from a Fate Question, a Random 
Event, a Meaning Table, or your own 
expectations, all becomes part of the Context 
which influences later expectations. It all 
builds together creating a layered, detailed, 
and consistent adventure

When setting up this first Scene the Player had 
established that Rapid would encounter a new 
NPC, a team dealing with the problem. Now 
that the problem has been determined, this seems 
like a logical time to encounter the team. This is 
a well grounded expectation so the Player doesn’t 
feel a need to ask a Fate Question for it.
However, the Player does ask: “Does Rapid 
recognize the team helping people?” Giving 
this Odds of Likely, Mythic comes back with 
Exceptional Yes.
The Player interprets this to mean that not 
only does Rapid recognize them but they are a 
famous group of superheros.
The Player considers making up a name for 
the team but figures it would be more fun to roll 
up a random name. Using the Names Elements 
Table they roll “Fah” and “Ow”. Needing more 
inspiration the Player keeps rolling and gets “N” 
and “R”. This kind of sounds like “Founder”, so the 
Player goes with a team name of “The Founders”

Arriving in the midst of downtown, Rapid sees 
the arcing blue energy up close tearing apart 
buildings and roads. However, people are 
already being rescued by a group of superheroes: 
the world famous Founders

Rapid gets in on the action and uses his super 
speed to help rescue people threatened by the 
anomaly. The Player wants a situation for their 
PC to get involved. There’s no need to ask a Fate 
Question about this, it’s already been established 
that there is general mayhem going on. There is, 
undoubtedly, plenty of opportunities for Rapid 
to help.
The Player decides to Discover Meaning to 
help determine what emergency Rapid can help 
with. Rolling on the Actions Meaning Tables, 
the Player gets “Release” and “Vehicle”. The 
Player interprets this to mean that a car has 
been knocked to the edge of a freeway overpass 
when the road got warped by the wild energies. 
Someone is trapped in the car, which teeters on 
the brink of plummeting to the concrete below.
Rapid moves quickly, in a blur zooming along 
the road to the overpass. 
“Does the car start to fall before Rapid 
gets there?” The Player gives this Odds 
of Nearly Impossible considering his 
fantastic speed and Mythic says No. 
Rapid arrives at the car, pulls the driver 
out of it, and deposits them safely a block away 
before they are even aware of what is going on.
The Player doesn’t want to role-play every 
save in this crisis, just the one to set some flavor 
for the Scene. They wonder though if the rip 
in reality closes up, or if this is going to be an 
ongoing situation. The Player asks “Does 
the rift close?” This seems Very Likely to 
the Player. With the Chaos Factor still at its 
starting value of 5, they roll on the Fate Chart 
getting a 22. This is a Yes, but also a Random 
Event since double digits were 
rolled and the single digit value is less than or 
equal to the Chaos Factor.
The Player rolls 91 on the Random Event 
Focus Table, “Current Context”. Rolling on 
the Actions Meaning Tables, the Player gets 
“Imprison” and “Representative”.
The Player interprets this to mean that the 
enormous rift in space closes as mysteriously as it 
appeared, but The Founders captured someone, 
or something, associated with it.
“Do I find out what’s going on?” The Player 
gives this Question Odds of Nearly Certain, 
figuring that since Rick helped the hero team 
with the crisis they will clue him in on what 
they found.
The Player already established that a 
representative of the world beyond the rift had 
been captured. To get some idea of what this 
NPC looks like the Player turns to the Character 
Appearance Elements Table, rolling “Strange” 
and “Colorful”

The leader of The Founders beckons Rick to 
join the team as they gather around something. 
Laying on the ground is a strange creature. It 
looks like an enormous flying eye, with bright 
red, leathery skin

“It came through the rift,” a member of The 
Founders said. “We subdued it right away.”

The Player followed their expectations with 
that moment. They could have asked Fate 
Questions to establish more details, or Discovered 
Meaning, but at this point they had a pretty good 
idea how the Scene was panning out and wanted 
to run with their own impressions.
The Player had earlier established that The 
Founders was a superhero team, but now wants 
to give them a little more detail by coming up 
with some facts about a few of the members. The 
Player doesn’t want to take the time to detail 
every NPC on the team, but two sounds good.
Starting with the leader of The Founders, the 
Player figures it would be good to know their 
main power and their name. Turning to the 
Powers Elements Table, the Player rolls “Others” 
and “Emission”. The Player interprets this to 
mean that the ability is a powerful eye beam blast.
To give the leader a name the Player rolls on 
the Names Elements Table for inspiration, getting 
“R” and “Wah”. The Player interprets this into 
the name Ra, the hero maintains an Egyptian sun 
god motif to accompany his fiery eye blasts.
For the second member of the team the 
Player rolls again on the Powers Table and gets 
“Damage” and “Emotion”. This is interpreted 
as a mental power, the ability to control others’ 
emotions to make them run out of control.
Rolling on the Names Table, the Player gets 
“Fi” and “Ar”. That’s not enough to make an 
interpretation so the Player continues rolling and 
gets “Oh” and “Ah”. The Player interprets this 
into Fear Aura.
There are more members of The Founders, but 
that’s enough for now. This seems like a good 
place to wrap up the first Scene. The Player writes 

a summary on the Adventure Journal, marking 
down Scene 1. While there are a lot of unknowns 
right now, such as where the rift came from and 
will it return, Rapid Red and The Founders 
succeeded in minimizing the crisis. The Player is 
going to count this as the PC mostly being in 
control of the Scene, giving the Chaos Factor a -1 
modifier down to 4

Editing the Adventure Lists, the Player adds 
“Why the rift?” on the Threads List. On the 
Characters List goes “The Founders”, “Ra”, “Fear 
Aura”, and “Captured Alien”. Thinking about it a 
moment, the Player decides to also put down “City” 
to account for the people in the city and “The 
Blurb” to represent where Rick works in his alter 
ego time and the friends he has there who might 
become a part of the adventure given the chance.

It’s time for the next Scene. The Player 
expects The Founders to take the prisoner back 
to their headquarters for questioning. Given the 
friendliness Ra showed Rick in the first Scene it 
would make sense that the PC would accompany 
the hero team

The Chaos Factor is currently at 4. The Player 
rolls a d10 to test this Expected Scene idea and 
gets a 2, an Interrupt.
Right away the adventure is taking an 
unexpected turn.
The Player needs to roll up a Random Event as 
inspiration for how this unexpected Scene starts. 
Rolling on the Random Events Focus Table gives 
“NPC Action”. To figure out which NPC acts 
the Player rolls on the Characters List. There are 
6 entries on the List, just barely breaking into 
the second section. This means the Player has to 
roll two dice, a d4 to determine which section of 
the List to roll in and a d10 to determine which 
element in that section is selected.
The Player rolls a 3 and a 6. This leads us to 
the second section of the Characters List and a 
blank line.
When getting a blank line on a List we get the 
option to choose an element on the List or to roll 
again. The Player thinks it would make the most 
sense if the captured alien did something. The 
Founders just captured the strange visitor, which 
came from another world. Who knows what it’s 
capable of or what mayhem it might cause.

Rolling a blank line on the Characters or 
Threads List gives us the option of choosing 
an element instead of randomly rolling it. 
This is an opportunity for you to nudge the 
narrative of your adventure in a direction 
that seems the most logical or exciting. 
However, if you don’t want this control or a 
choice isn’t obvious you can instead choose to 
roll again to let the dice decide

The Player considers which Meaning Table to 
roll on for this Random Event. It’s about the alien 
doing something, so maybe the Actions Meaning 
Tables. However, it’s a Character doing the action, 
so perhaps one of the Character oriented tables. 
They choose the Characters Elements Table. 
Rolling, the Player gets “Friend” and “Unexpected”. 
These results make the Player reconsider who 
the alien is and what it represents.

Back at The Founders headquarters, the alien is 
kept in a containment force field. The creature 
wakes and, communicating telepathically, tells 
them it has come as a friend to help

The alien saying it is friendly is certainly 
unexpected, considering the amount of damage 
that accompanied its arrival.
This gives the Player some ideas but before 
running with them they want to get more 
information from the alien. The Player rolls on 
the Character Conversations Elements Table for 
inspiration on what the alien says to explain itself.
The Player rolls “Inform” and “Threatening”. 
This gives the Player some interpretations but 
nothing they are certain of. The Player tests their 
top idea with a Fate Question.
“Does it warn us of an impending invasion 
from its home dimension?” That sounds like a 
plausible interpretation, the Player assigns it Odds 
of Likely. Checking this against the Chaos Factor 
of 4 on the Fate Chart gives us a 50% chance of 
being true. The Player rolls 26 for a Yes.
Before moving forward with a full interpretation 
the Player figures it’s time to give the alien a name. 
Rolling on the Names Elements Table they get 
“Ahg” and “Animal”. The Player considers this, 
and given that the alien is from another reality the 
name should be something that sounds a bit odd. 
The Player comes up with Ogberd.

The alien, who says his name is Ogberd, claims 
he traveled to our dimension to warn us of an 
impending invasion from his reality. He apologizes 
for the abrupt and dangerous arrival, but opening 
portals between worlds is messy business and it was 
the only way he could get here

The Player wants to ask the Fate Question 
“Do The Founders believe him?” Before 
assigning Odds, the Player decides that 
Rapid Red does believe Ogberd. Despite the 
devastation his traveling to our realm caused his
warning seems plausible. Also, if he’s correct, 
they need to act now.
The Player wants this to be a role-playing 
moment where the group discusses if they 
believe Ogberd’s account. Using the rules of 
the RPG the Player is using for this adventure, 
SuperBreakers!, Rapid Red makes a Persuasion 
Task Roll to convince The Founders to trust the 
alien. The roll succeeds.
The Player decides not to ask the Fate 
Question after all, letting the task resolution roll 
decide instead

Rick and The Founders discuss Ogberd’s claim. 
As wild as it sounds, if it’s true, the entire Earth 
could be at risk. The rift that disrupted downtown 
was evidence enough that powerful forces are at 
play. They can’t afford not to trust Ogberd. 

Even though The Founders believe, it would 
make sense that they try to verify the information 
anyway. Since this is The Founders, a famous 
group of heroes, and we are at their headquarters, 
the Player figures they likely have some high tech 
equipment that may help.
The Player poses this as a Fate Question, 
asking “Do The Founders have some tech to help 
verify Ogberd’s claim?” The Player gives this 
Odds of Very Likely. 
With the Chaos Factor at 4 and with Odds 
of Very Likely, the Fate Chart gives this a 65% 
chance of a Yes. The Player rolls 24 for Yes.
The Player considers asking more Questions, 
or perhaps Discovering Meaning, to narrow down 
what technology they have that would be helpful 
but decides that would slow the adventure down 
too much right now. The Player instead chooses 
to improvise and run with their expectations.

The Founders headquarters is full of amazing 
technology that Rick has never seen before. With 
Ogberd’s help, a Founder scientist uses a device 
to open a channel of communication between 
our world and his. Ogberd is able to reach 
companions of his there, members of a resistance
opposing the invasion, who confirm the warning 
and show The Founders what they are up against.

The Player needs to figure out what they 
learned, who is invading, and how?
They start with a Fate Question, “Is this a 
warlord of some kind?” The Player assigns Odds 
of Nearly Certain. An alternative explanation 
could be some kind of natural force or army of 
creatures, but so far this all sounds like something 
intentionally done by a conqueror. With a Chaos 
Factor of 4 the Fate Chart gives a 75% chance. 
The Player rolls 12. This is within the 75, but 
such a low roll that it falls within the Exceptional 
range of 15 or less. The answer is Exceptional Yes.
So the villain is a warlord and then some. Since 
we’re talking about dimensional travel and the 
end of worlds, the Player interprets this to mean 
that the villain is not only a conqueror from 
that other reality but a very powerful being that 
rules the entire dimension. We are dealing with a 
cosmic force.
The Player wants to get a better idea of what 
this being is like. Discovering Meaning to 
generate details, the Player rolls on the Characters 
Elements Table and gets “Combative” and 
“Anxious”. Combative certainly fits into what 
we’ve seen so far, and anxious makes it sound like 
this ruler is maybe paranoid and power hungry.
To get an idea of what powers this cosmic 
being possesses, the Player rolls on the Powers 
Elements Table and gets “Skill” and “Magic”. The 
Player interprets this to mean that the being is a 
powerful sorcerer with godlike abilities.
To give this being a name the Player rolls on 
the Names Table, getting “Or” and “Tal”. The 
Player wants more prompts so continues rolling, 
getting “Lee” and “Et”. The Player interprets this 
into Orta Leet.
This seems like a good place to end the Scene. 
A lot was learned and the adventure has really 
taken focus. The Player updates the Adventure 
Journal, summarizing this Scene. When adjusting 
the Chaos Factor, the Player considers whether 
or not Rapid Red was in control. He was 
instrumental in convincing The Founders to trust 
Ogberd, however learning about the impending 
invasion introduced a huge threat that they don’t 
have an answer for. The Player decides this means 
the PC was less in control, although it’s a close 
call. They raise the Chaos Factor to 5.
Editing the Adventure Lists, the Player crosses 
out “Why the rift?” on the Threads List. The PC 
discovered why the downtown crisis happened so 
that goal is solved. They add a new Thread with 
“Stop the invasion.”
On the Characters List, the Player updates 
“Captured Alien” to “Ogberd”, reflecting 
learning his name. Characters that were 
important in this Scene included “The Founders” 
and “Ogberd” so the Player gives each an 
additional entry on the List reflecting their 
growing importance to this adventure
The Player also adds “Orta Leet”, the cosmic 
entity and threat they are facing.
Since Ogberd’s companions on the other side 
were helpful the Player decides to include them on 
the List as well, calling them “Resistance fighters”.
A lot happened in that Scene to change the 
focus of the adventure. Rapid Red has to help 
The Founders avert a dimensional invasion of 
cosmic proportions.
For the next Scene, the Player figures that 
if Ogberd took the trouble to travel to our 
dimension he had more in mind than just 
warning us. He probably has a solution. The 
Player doesn’t know what this solution is yet, or if 
it exists, but that sounds like a good basis for the 
next Scene.
With the Chaos Factor back at 5, the Player 
tests this Expected Scene by rolling a d10 and gets 
7. The Expected Scene happens.
So, Ogberd has a plan. The Player decides to 
ask a Fate Question to help figure out what he 
has in mind. “Is there something here, on Earth, 
that will help us fight Orta?” The Player just took 
a wild guess with this Question, it was the first 
thing that came to mind. They don’t have any 
real confidence in it, however, so they assign it 
Odds of 50/50. With the Chaos Factor at 5, the 
chances of a Yes are 50%. The Player rolls and 
Mythic says Yes.
The Player considers asking more Questions to 
pinpoint what this weapon is but instead decides 
to Discover Meaning by rolling on the Actions 
Meaning Tables. Maybe finding out what this 
thing does will help define what it is. The Player 
rolls “Praise” and “Hope”.
The Player has to think about this one, and 
decides to stretch the literal meaning of those 
words to reach an interpretation
Since Orta is a mystical being, the word “Praise” 
almost sounds magical. “Hope” in this Context 
could be protection or a way to banish Orta.
The Players goes with this interpretation:

Ogberd tells The Founders that he traveled to 
Earth to warn us, but also to find a long lost 
book of magic that contains a spell to banish 
Orta Leet from our dimension and from his. The 
book was brought here long ago by evil acolytes of 
Orta as a way to hide the tome from those who 
would seek to end her despotic rule.

This brings a new mission for Rapid Red, to 
recover the book. The Player asks, “Does Ogberd 
know where the book is?” The Player gives this 
Odds of Likely. The Fate Chart says this has a 
65% chance, and the roll comes back a Yes.
To figure out where the book is, the Player rolls 
on the Locations Elements Meaning Table for 
inspiration and gets “Confusing” and “Unpleasant”.

Ogberd says he knows where the book is, sort of. 
It was ensconced in a graveyard in France several 
centuries ago. He’s not sure what graveyard, 
however, or where in the graveyard it is.

This is going to require some detective work to 
locate the book, but Rapid has a solid lead at least.
The Player knows that their PC is going to go 
after the book, and figures Ogberd will go with 
him. They’re not sure if any of The Founders will 
go so the Player turns it into a Fate Question: 
“Do any of The Founders accompany Rapid?” 
Considering how important this mission is the 
Player gives this Odds of Nearly Certain, an 85% 
chance.

However, the Player rolls a 92 for a No. The 
Player makes this interpretation:

Rapid prepares for the journey to Europe with 
Ogberd, expecting members of The Founders 
to go with him. He’s excited to work with the 
famous team! However, he’s surprised when they 
tell him that he and the visitor from another 
world will be handling this mission alone.
Ra has decided that he thinks searching for the 
spellbook is an uncertain solution. He and the 
team are going to focus on preparing defenses 
against the invasion and contacting heroes and 
governments across the world to get ready.

It’s in Rapid’s hands now to maybe save the 
world, assuming that Ogberd is correct about 
the spell.
The Player decides this is a good spot to end 
the Scene. This Scene was mostly information, 
answering questions about the looming crisis and 
deciding what to do next.
The Player updates the Adventure Journal with 
a Scene 3 summary. Since this Scene involved 
coming up with a plan of action to stop Orta, a 
plan that Rapid is centrally involved in, the Player 
decides that their PC was in control of this Scene 
and lowers the Chaos Factor to 4.
The Player updates the Threads List by adding 
another line for “Stop the invasion”, since that 
was a big part of this Scene, and also adds “Find 
the book”.
On the Characters List, the Player adds another 
line for “Ogberd” since the planning in this Scene 
mostly revolved around him. That’s Ogberd’s 
third appearance on the Characters List, which 

means he is maxed out and won’t get any more 
listings from future Scenes.
The Player considers adding another instance 
of “The Founders” but they didn’t play a big 
role in this Scene. The Player decides not to add 
another listing for them.
Rapid Red’s adventure continues as he and 
the visitor from another world travel to France in 
order to find a spell to save the world from their 
magical foe.
