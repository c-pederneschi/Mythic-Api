## Mythic Adventures

T
he Mythic Game Master Emulator replaces
a live Game Master (GM) with a set of rules
that emulate a GM’s creative decision-making,
allowing you to play any role-playing game (RPG)
solo or in a group without a designated person to
run things. Mythic becomes your GM, answering
your questions and progressing the adventure one
step at a time. While the system is based in your
expectations and interpretations, it’s designed
to periodically subvert those expectations and
introduce surprises to keep the narrative exciting.
This may sound complicated, but Mythic’s core
mechanics are deceptively simple, and once you
put them into practice it won’t be long before it all
starts to click.
Let’s go over the various ways that Mythic can
be used as well as the individual components that
make it all work.
## MYTHIC, YOUR ROLE-PLAYING PARTNER

There are a number of ways you can use the

Mythic Game Master Emulator. Here are a few to
get you started.
Solo Role-Play
Mythic is designed primarily for solo role-
playing, where you play alone with your RPG
system of choice and use Mythic to answer
questions, resolve the action, and guide the
narrative along.

### Group Role-Play With No GM

The same rules that allow you to play solo
can also be used by a group of Players referring
to Mythic for answers instead of a GM. Group
play like this requires Players to agree on when
to ask questions, what questions to ask, and how
to interpret results. Exactly how you arrange
to play will depend on your particular group’s
dynamics; see the sidebar “Mythic With a

## Group” on page 8 for some suggestions.

How does Mythic emulate and replace a living
human being who would otherwise be running
your game?
Mythic uses a few concepts to achieve this end:
 » A Yes/No question and answer mechanic
 » Random Events that add surprises
 » Meaning Tables that offer inspirational
prompts for important details
 » Lists tracking important goals and characters
which are randomly selected when called for
 » A Scene structure to give your adventure
form and order
 » A Chaos Factor that changes the tempo of the
adventure as you play
Everything above is guided by your expectations
and interpretations based on the ongoing
Context. This makes sure the adventure continues
in a coherent fashion while still allowing for twists
and subversions that keep things exciting.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
66 77

Co-GM
The tools that allow you to generate adventures
on the fly also allow a GM to run a traditional
role-playing group using Mythic behind the
scenes. This gives you the freedom to decide how
much you want to come up with yourself and how
much you want to discover in play.
You could start your adventure with no prep
and use Mythic to come up with everything as
you go, leaving you almost as surprised as your
players, or you could generate the adventure in
advance and tweak things to your liking before
you hit the table with your group. If you’d
rather split the difference, Mythic can be used
to come up with “adventure seeds” that act as
a springboard for your own ideas without you
having to start from scratch.
If you’d prefer to do most of the prep work
yourself, you could use Mythic to fill in the gaps
of your outline or shape anything you hadn’t
counted on once the adventure is live. Mythic can
easily become your advisor, suggesting twists or
alternatives to what you already have that you can
run with or discard as you see fit.
    ... And Another Thing ...
Above are the most common ways Mythic can
be used. However, imaginative players can find
other ways to use Mythic as well.
For example, Mythic can be used as a writing
tool to help you craft fictional stories. Since
Mythic is, at its heart, a narrative constructor, it’s
only natural that it’d make as good an assistant
writer as it does an assistant GM.
If you love being a Game Master, you can flip
the script and use Mythic to emulate live Players
instead, asking Fate Questions to see what the
Player Characters do as you run them through an
adventure or published module.
Speaking of published modules, Mythic can
also be used to run yourself through a published
adventure solo; you can find guidance for this on
page 156.

## The possibilities are endless!

A group of players using Mythic to guide their
adventure should decide ahead of time how
decisions will be made, such as what the first
Scene will be, how to come up with Expected
Scenes, when to ask Questions, what Questions
to ask, and how to interpret Mythic’s answers
and prompts. Here are a few suggestions on
how to divvy up this work:
DECIDE AS A GROUP: Have everyone collaborate
and make decisions together. This can be efficient
if you all work well together; however, it can
also slow things down as you pause to reach a
consensus at every decision point.
CHOOSE A PRIMARY GUIDE:  Pick one person
to have the final say after hearing everyone
else’s suggestions. This has the benefits of
group improvisation and moves faster than
deciding everything as a group.
ROTATING GUIDE:  Choose a Primary Guide,
then periodically change who that Guide is,
such as every Scene or every dice roll. This is
probably the best balance of group input and
game efficiency. Everyone gets their chance
to be in control, and no one Player bears
the full burden of decision-making because
responsibility is shared evenly around the table.
The methods above all require Players to
cooperate and trust each other. Each of you
needs to accept that your ideas won’t always
prevail, and that’s okay. You’re a group of
storytellers working together in a tradition
going back thousands of years. There’s also the
satisfaction of knowing that none of you are
fully in control: Mythic is part of the group as
well, acting as the Game Master who ultimately
determines whether or not your ideas play out
as expected.

# FATE QUESTIONS

Fate Questions are the core of Mythic, the
mechanism through which the adventure moves
forward. The idea behind Fate Questions is that
you can ask Mythic anything, posed as a Yes/No
Question, just as if you were asking a live Game
Master. Is the room occupied? Does the alien
attack? Do I find any ammunition after searching
the house? Is the treasure chest locked? Does the
wizard cast a spell?
When you ask a Fate Question, you decide on
the Odds that the answer will be Yes based on
your impression of the adventure so far, or the
Context. Mythic uses common language for Odds
to make them as intuitive as possible, such as
Likely, 50/50, or Nearly Certain.
Once you have your Question and your Odds,
you consult the Fate Chart to get the percentage
chance of a Yes answer, then you roll 1d100. If you
roll that percentage or less then the answer is Yes;
if you roll above it then the answer is No. Rolling
very low or very high will give you Exceptional Yes
or Exceptional No, respectively. Once you have
your answer you interpret it in the Context of the
current adventure and keep playing.
With each Question having four possible
answers the narrative of your adventure will shift
slightly with every Question you ask, and the
answers you receive and how you interpret them
will shape the Context. This process of Question,
answer, interpretation builds on itself: every new
Question adds Context and sends the adventure
in a direction, leading to the next Question
which does the same, and so on. In this way Fate

## Questions construct your adventure as you play.

The further along you get the more naturally the
process flows.

## Fate Questions are discussed in the “Fate

Questions” chapter on page 17.


---

# CHAOS FACTOR

A good GM knows when to ramp up the
tension and when to ease off and let the players
catch their breath. This ebb and flow of action is a
crucial part of any adventure and it rarely stays the
same throughout.
The Chaos Factor is Mythic’s way of simulating
this changing tempo. It uses a value between 1
and 9 to measure how much control the PC has
over the action. The higher the value the more

## Mythic generates active elements such as Random

Events, unexpected Scenes, and Yes answers to
Fate Questions.

## The Chaos Factor is discussed in the “Fate

Questions” chapter on page 17.
You don’t need much more than this book to get
a Mythic adventure off the ground.

### Mythic Fate Questions and tables require the use

of  two d10 dice. These are usually rolled to get
percentile results (1-100). You’ll also need a d4,
d6, and d8 for rolling on Lists.
Any sheets and forms you may need are included
with this rulebook. You can also find downloads
for them on the wordmillgames.com  website.

# MYTHIC ADVENTURES


## You may be familiar with the first edition of Mythic Game Master

Emulator and wondering, “What has changed?” While the rules
have been completely rewritten most of the core components
of Mythic are the same while much has been added or refined.

## Here is a summary of the biggest changes:

THE FATE CHART: Odds have been slightly simplified and some
of their titles changed to hopefully give a more intuitive feel for
deciding Odds as you play. The table itself has been redesigned
to also make it more intuitive, and some of the percentages have
been lowered to add more uncertainty to Fate Question answers.
THE FATE CHECK: This mechanic was brought in from Mythic
Variations II. It has been refined to make it feel more like the
Fate Chart.

### RANDOM EVENT FOCUS TABLE: The Focus Table has a new

addition to it, “Current Context”. The d100 roll values have also
been slightly re-balanced.
CHOICES: Mythic GME Second Edition gives more power to Player
choices. You’ll find rules pertaining to choices throughout the
book. For instance, choosing an Event Focus instead of rolling is
an option.
LISTS: There is more direction in how to handle Lists in a
defined way. Lists are also weighted, with elements able to
appear more than once on a List. This makes Threads and
Characters Lists more dynamic.
MEANING TABLES:  Some of the words in the Actions and

### Descriptions Meaning Tables have been changed to make their

meaning more clear.
ELEMENTS MEANING TABLES:  In addition to the Actions and

### Descriptions Meaning Tables there are 45 Elements Meaning


### Tables that are more specifically themed. This gives you the

option to choose a Meaning Table that is most relevant to the
current Context.
OPTIONS: There are a lot of options throughout Second Edition,
more ways for you to customize your Mythic experience. These
run a wide gamut, from choosing how you want to start and end

## Scenes to mechanics like Keyed Scenes to guide your adventure.

DISCOVERING MEANING:  Referred to as “Complex Questions”
in Mythic Variations, Discovering Meaning is about generating
adventure details by rolling on a Meaning Table. This takes on
greater significance in Second Edition with the wider range of

### Meaning Tables.

# MYTHIC ADVENTURES

# RANDOM EVENTS


## Although most of your adventure is built upon

Fate Questions, Mythic will periodically interject
new elements at random. These Random Events
allow Mythic to add surprises and plot twists that
aren’t based in your expectations, guaranteeing
that you’ll never know for sure what’s going to
happen next.

## Random Events can occur when you ask a


## Fate Question or when you start a new Scene.


### They are generated using the Event Focus Table

and the Meaning Tables. The Event Focus tells
you which aspect of the adventure the Random

### Event involves, while the Meaning Tables

give you a pair of words meant to inspire an
interpretation of what the Random Event is. If
the Event Focus Table gives you “PC (Player

### Character) Positive”, and the Meaning Tables

give you the words “attainment” and “travel”,
you might interpret these words to mean that
your post-apocalyptic PC has found a working
vehicle, or that your high-fantasy PC has found
a possible means of escaping the dungeon they’re
trapped in.

## Random Events are discussed in the “Random

Events” chapter on page 35.


---

# SCENES

To keep your unfolding adventure within a
structured narrative Mythic divides the action
into Scenes. What constitutes a Scene is up to
you, but just like in a movie a Scene should
be a discrete portion of your adventure that
encapsulates an important moment or event. A
Warrior searching through a cave system and
battling lizardmen or a space-traveler walking
through a market and buying supplies for his ship
can both be a Scene.
When the important action in that Scene is over
the Scene ends and we move on to the next Scene.

# MYTHIC ADVENTURES

The end of a Scene is when Bookkeeping takes
place: updating the Threads and Characters Lists
and adjusting the Chaos Factor.
Scenes are discussed in the “Scenes” chapter on
page 59.
LISTS
Mythic uses a simple List system to keep
track of important goals and characters in your
adventure. The Threads List is for adventure
objectives while the Characters List is for
important Non-Player Characters (NPCs). These

## Lists are adjusted at the end of each Scene with

Threads and Characters being added or removed.
(You can also add Threads and Characters as they
appear if you’d prefer.) Lists come into play with
Random Events which use the Lists as random
tables that you roll on to select which Thread or

## Character the Random Event is referring to.

Lists are discussed in the “Scenes” chapter on
pages 60 and 111.


---

# MEANING


### Meaning Tables serve a purpose beyond

Random Events: they can also be used to add detail
to your adventure without asking a Fate Question.
Asking a Yes/No Question assumes that
you have some expectation for the outcome.
You might ask the Question “Is there a
mushroom person in the cavern?” because you’ve
encountered mushroom people in your adventure
before and have come to expect seeing them.
However, there will be Questions for which
you have no expectations, and times when you
want detail that doesn’t fit easily into a Yes/No
framework. Questions about what something
looks like or what someone does can fall into
this category. In cases like these, you can get the
information you need through Meaning Tables
or through one or more Fate Questions. Both
options can achieve the same narrative end, and
the one you use in a given situation may simply
depend on your preferences.

## The Player Character (PC) encounters a new

Non-Player Character (NPC) in an alternate
dimension, and the Player has no idea who or
what the Character could be. They could ask
a Fate Question like, “Is this person hostile?”,
or they could go to the Meaning Tables to get
inspirational words for what the NPC looks
like and how they initially act. Maybe they roll

## The core rules for using Mythic Game Master

Emulator to run solo role-playing adventures
are spelled out in three main chapters: Fate
Questions, Random Events, and Scenes. These
chapters tell you everything you need to know to
run exciting and effective Mythic adventures.
If you want to add more to your Mythic
experience check out the Variations  chapter.
This section has additional rule supplements,
variations on the core mechanics that might
better suit your play style, and discussions on
how to use the Mythic system in different ways.
If, on the other hand, you’re unfamiliar with
solo role-playing or unsure of how the rules in
this book are used in play, The Big Example
offers a detailed demonstration of Mythic in
action that will hopefully shed some light on the
system’s ins and outs.
You’ll find a quick reference guide to the core
rules in the Rules Summary  chapter. This is
handy for when you need a brief refresher on
Mythic’s mechanics.
The final portion of this book is a collection
of all the tables and charts found throughout,
gathered in one place for easy reference during
play. These pages have had the top and bottom
borders removed for cleaner printing so that
you can make copies for your own personal use.

“ruin” and “mundane” and interpret this to
mean that when the NPC is encountered he is

time to get a pair of words to use for inspiration

# EXPECTATIONS &

# INTERPRETATIONS

The rules above are all tied together by two
things that come from you: expectations and
interpretations. The mechanics for generating
adventures on the fly while still forming a
cohesive narrative hinge on you following your
expectations, testing those expectations with
Questions as you see fit, and interpreting the
results of those tests. Your interpretations then
become narrative fact, which feeds into your ever-
evolving expectations of what happens next.
Expectations
Most Mythic play is done improvisationally:
you decide in the moment what your PC does
and how they respond to a given situation. You
also improvise any details and circumstances in
the adventure world that you don’t feel the need
to test. This is you following your expectations
about the adventure.
For example, let’s say a sci-fi PC is walking
through a crowded market on a space station.
His Player doesn’t feel the need to randomly
generate the details of the market, so they decide
that the market is what they expect.
Your expectations are used in Mythic to
determine what is happening in the adventure
much of the time. Just like with the space station
This book uses a lot of phrases and terms you may
or may not be familiar with. Here are the most
frequently used terms and their abbreviations:
Chaos Factor (CF): A value between 1 and 9
used to control how much activity Mythic throws
at you during an adventure.
Characters: Important people (and sometimes
non-people) who populate your adventure. Player
Characters (PCs) are characters controlled by you,
the Player(s). Non-Player Characters (NPCs) are
the characters your PCs interact with during an
adventure which are mostly controlled by Mythic.
d100: Shorthand for a pair of ten-sided dice
rolled together. You’ll see other dice types
mentioned as well, such as d4, d6, d8, d10, and
2d10 (rolling two ten-sided dice and adding them
together instead of treating them as a “tens” die
and a “ones” die like you do for d100).
Fate Questions: Mythic’s central mechanic for
generating information about your adventure as
you play.
Game Master (GM): The person in charge of
running an RPG. When playing solo, you and
Mythic share the role of GM.
Lists: When capitalized, this refers to the Threads

## List and Characters List of a Mythic adventure.

Random Events: These are unexpected
occurrences in your adventure that Mythic uses
a special procedure to create.
Role-Playing Game (RPG): An organized system
of rules for playing out engaging, immersive
stories. While Mythic can be played on its own,
it’s most commonly paired with a separate RPG,
which the rules refer to as your “chosen RPG”.
Scenes: Basic units of in-game time. When you see
the rules refer to Scenes with a capital S, they’re
referring to a Mythic Scene in your adventure.
Threads:  Tracked goals your PC is pursuing in
an adventure.

example, we often have expectations about
what’s going on and what will happen next: how
something looks, how a creature acts, what’s
inside a treasure chest, whether the damaged
vehicle will operate, and so on. These expectations
will change throughout the adventure based on
the events that unfold.
Everything that happens in your adventure
which you establish as narrative fact is Context,
and Context is what you base your expectations
on. As the Context grows through play, your
expectations become more developed.
You follow your expectations when you are
sure of them. In the example above, the Player
felt they understood what the space station was
like because they had come across other space
stations earlier in the adventure. There was plenty
of Context to build these expectations on, so the
Player decided that their expectations did not
need to be tested.
While your expectations will often be
sufficient, you may choose to test them at any
time. Usually you’ll do this when you aren’t sure
exactly what to expect or when you have multiple
possible expectations.
Our sci-fi PC wants to hire more crew for his
ship, so he goes to a bar because he’s had success
in picking up crewmembers in such places before.
After buying a drink, he asks the bartender if she
knows of anyone looking for work. The Player
thinks the bartender would know, but they aren’t
sure. It’s time to test this expectation and see
what the bartender says.
Testing an expectation in Mythic is done
through Fate Questions. You pose your
expectation as a Yes/No Question, assign it Odds
based on your confidence in getting a Yes answer,
and roll on the Fate Chart.
If you get a Yes, then events unfold as you
expected; if you get a No, then something else
happens instead.

## The Player poses their expectation as a Fate

Question by asking, “Does the bartender direct
me to a possible hire?” with the chosen Odds of
Very Likely. A Yes would mean the bartender
does know of a hire and directs the character
to them; a No would mean she doesn’t know of
anyone looking for work.
Interpretation

## Once you’ve tested your expectations with a

Fate Question you then interpret the answer you
receive. Mythic provides a general framework
of four possible answers to your Questions: Yes,
No, Exceptional Yes, and Exceptional No. Just as
your expectations guide you through developing
detail in your adventure, they also form the basis
of your interpretations.

### This book assumes you’re familiar with table-top

role-playing; however, even seasoned role-players
may not be familiar with playing solo. If you’re new
to this style of play, one way to get accustomed
is to see others doing it. I’ve peppered this book
with italicized examples that illustrate various
Mythic concepts, and one of the later chapters is
an extended example that demonstrates how all
of these concepts work together.
There are also many talented solo role-
players online who make videos and podcasts
documenting their adventures. Not only are
these episodes fantastically entertaining, they
also serve as excellent examples of how to solo
role-play. Each host runs their games in their
own ways, which gives you the opportunity to
see a variety of play styles. You can find these
shows through a Google search or by asking
around online role-playing communities; I’ve
compiled a list of some in the “Resources”
section of wordmillgames.com.

# MYTHIC ADVENTURES

An interpretation of a Yes answer from the
bartender could be this: The bartender smiles
and nods. “Oh yeah, there’s a few hungry people
around here looking for work. See that guy in the
corner booth? Go talk to him.”
An Exceptional Yes might be interpreted this
way: The bartender taps the bar top, and a
monitor inside it lights up. “Check the board—
it’s full of people looking for work. Dozens,
maybe hundreds. You should have no problem.”

## An interpretation of a No answer could be this:

The bartender shakes her head. “Sorry, you’re
not the only captain looking for crew. I don’t
know of anyone looking for work right now.”
An Exceptional No might be interpreted this
way: The bartender gives him a serious look.
“This station is corporation owned; it’s illegal
for independents to try and hire crew here. I’ll
pretend I didn’t hear you.”
All of the interpretations above were
informed by the Context of previous encounters:
crewmembers often hang out in bars on stations;
there are other ship captains on this station;
corporations are a force in this adventure; their
influence is stronger in some places than others.

## Putting It All Together

When you interpret an answer Mythic gives
you, that interpretation becomes narrative fact
and part of the Context for future Questions and
expectations. Mythic adventures proceed in this
fashion from one interesting moment to the next,
building your adventure detail by detail.

## Mythic is meant to fill the role of Game

Master for your role-playing adventures. It can be
used with just about any RPG out there, allowing
you to play the game while Mythic answers your
questions just like a Game Master would.
Playing an RPG by yourself can take some getting
used to, particularly if you’re accustomed to the
traditional dynamic between yourself, your GM,
and your fellow gamers. There is a dynamic to
solo role-playing as well, but it’s one you have to
discover on your own because it will be unique to
your style of play and what you enjoy most about
the gaming experience.
My suggestion is to try one or two “practice”
adventures with Mythic to get a feel for how it
works. Don’t try to force anything; let yourself
experiment and make mistakes. You’ll probably
hit a few sticking points, but as you work past
them, you’ll develop a sense of how everything
works. Once you get past those initial hurdles,
solo role-playing becomes much easier and much
more exciting, and you’ll find your adventures
flowing smoothly as you find your groove.
While a solo role-playing experience loses the
social aspects of RPGs, it gains whole new
aspects that aren’t possible with group play.
You can explore any theme or adventure in any
way you wish, make your adventures as big or
as small as you like, as epic or as personal. Solo
role-playing really is an experience like no other.
You may find that playing solo makes you a
better player or Game Master in a traditional
group setting. The solo experience gets you
to think about characters and adventures
in ways you may not have before, and these
perspectives and experiences can easily carry
over into social role-playing.

Fate Questions
A
sking and answering questions is the heart
of a Mythic adventure, your principal tool
for learning about the game world and
moving the narrative forward.

## Mythic handles this process of inquiry using

Fate Questions: ask a Yes/No Question, determine
the Odds of the answer being Yes, consult the
Fate Chart to get the percentile chance, and roll
1d100. Your roll will determine whether the
answer is Yes, No, Exceptional Yes, or Exceptional
No. Interpret the result within the Context of
your adventure and continue playing.
All of your Questions about the adventure can
be resolved in this manner. “Are there monsters
in this room?” “Is the door locked?” “Is it raining
today?” Anything you would ask your Game

## Master in a social role-playing game you can ask

Mythic in a solo game.

# WHEN TO ASK A


---

# FATE QUESTION

As you play through an adventure, you improvise
the details based on what you expect your Character
to experience. You can pause your improvisation
at any time to test an expectation with a Fate
Question; usually, you do this during a moment of
narrative tension or when you’re unsure of what will
happen next.
The Player Character is on a distant planetary
colony, trapped in a building overrun by
aggressive alien creatures. They find themself
in the building’s control room, where they plan
to activate the blast shields on all the windows
and doors in the structure. Everything seems to

be functioning fine, so The Player expects the
blast doors to respond, but they aren’t sure. What
if the aliens damaged something? The Player
decides to ask the Fate Question, “Do the blast
shields go up?”
Later in that same adventure, the PC is searching
for weapons and has made their way to the
colony’s armory. The Player doesn’t know if there
are any weapons left. Maybe the original colonists
cleaned out the armory when they first faced the
alien invasion. Since the Player is unsure, they
ask Mythic, “Are there weapons here?”


---

# THE FATE CHART

The Fate Chart on the following page is used
to determine the percentile chances of your Fate
Questions receiving a Yes answer. Along the left
side are probability descriptors (Impossible, Likely,
Nearly Certain, etc.), and along the bottom is the
Chaos Factor.
When asking a Fate Question, decide what you
think the Odds are of the answer being Yes. This
is a gut decision based on the Question you’re
asking and the Context you’re asking it in. The

## Fate Chart’s Odds uses common language such as


## Likely or Impossible to judge probability.

Let’s say the Player Character is an occult
investigator searching a library for tomes of
magic. The Player decides to make this search
into a Fate Question: “Does he find any tomes?”
Maybe at this point in the adventure the PC
has come across strange magic and supernatural
events, and he knows that the library he’s
searching through once belonged to a sorcerer and
occultist. Given this Context the Player assigns
this Question the Odds of Likely.
On the other hand, maybe the original owner of
the library is unknown but the Player suspects
they might have been involved in magic. This
Context is different from the previous one:
there’s less evidence that books of magic would be
present. Given this Context the Player assigns the
Odds of 50/50.
Choosing Odds

## Who determines the Odds of a Fate Question?

Well, if you’re playing solo, then you do. If
you’re playing with a GM, then they do. If you’re
playing with a group then the Players must all
reach a consensus on how the Odds are chosen.
Mythic relies on Fate Questions to construct
the narrative of the adventure as you play; what
you ask and how you ask it will influence your
game. While it’s best to phrase Fate Questions as
naturally as possible, there are a few guidelines
you should keep in mind.
Action Oriented
The Chaos Factor assumes that Yes answers are
typically more active than No answers, so you’ll get
the best results if your Fate Questions focus on
active and interesting elements. “Are there zombies
outside?” is better than “Is it all clear outside?”

## Guided By Expectations

It’s generally best to let your Questions be guided
by your expectations rather than your desires. A
party of adventurers prowling down a dungeon
hall might easily ask, “Do we hear anything?”
but it would make little sense to ask, “Do I look
down and see a Vorpal Blade of Instant Murder
at my feet?” The current Context offers no logical
expectation to prompt the second Question, but
it does for the first.


---

# ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS

1818


---

# FATE QUESTIONS


## Your choices start in the middle at 50/50.

These are the Odds to choose if you think there’s
roughly a 50% chance of getting a Yes answer, or
if you have no idea of the probability. Odds range
upward from 50/50 to Likely, Very Likely, Nearly
Certain, and Certain, and downward from 50/50
to Unlikely, Very Unlikely, Nearly Impossible,
and Impossible.

## You may wonder at the Certain and Impossible

Odds. After all, if something is impossible or
certain then it’s a foregone conclusion, right?
Not necessarily. The Odds are based on what
you think they should be at the current moment,
and that opinion is based on the Context of the
adventure. Allowing some wiggle room in the
results of extreme Odds acknowledges that what
you and your PC know about the adventure is
not absolute. Something may seem certain or
impossible, but unfolding events can still prove us
wrong about what we thought we knew.
Extreme Odds can also become more or
less likely based on the Chaos Factor. When
the narrative is in high gear the impossible can
become probable for the sake of keeping tension
and excitement high.

## The Chaos Factor

The Chaos Factor is a value tracked throughout
the adventure that represents how much control
the Player Characters have over current events.
The more out of control Scenes get, the higher
the Chaos Factor will climb; the higher the Chaos
Factor, the greater your chance of getting a Yes
response to Fate Questions. The Chaos Factor

also determines the frequency of Random Events
and how often Scenes begin as expected.

## At the start of a new adventure the Chaos

Factor is set to 5. A Scene that was chaotic and out
of control increases the Chaos Factor by 1 point,
while a Scene in which the Player Characters were
mostly in control decreases it by 1. The value
cannot drop below 1 or rise above 9; results that
would push it beyond those limits are ignored.

## We’ll talk more about the ebb and flow of the


## Chaos Factor in the “Scenes” chapter.

The Chaos Factor has a big influence on the
percentile chance of your Fate Question being
a Yes. When consulting the Fate Chart, cross-
reference your chosen Odds on the left of the
Chart with the current Chaos Factor at the
bottom. The point at which these two intersect
on the Fate Chart is the chance of your Fate
Question being a Yes.
The occult investigator is searching the library
for tomes of forbidden lore. The Player has
determined that the Odds of finding such tomes
are Likely. After all, this is the personal library of
the mad mage Angus McGregor. The only reason
they aren’t assigning higher Odds is because the
mage would probably keep his best books in a
hidden location.

## Things have been fairly calm in the last few

Scenes, with the Character maintaining control
for the most part, so the Chaos Factor currently
sits at a value of 3. Comparing the Odds of
Likely to the current Chaos Factor, the Player
determines that there is a 35% chance of finding
a tome of magic sitting on one of the shelves.

# SHIFTING TONE

A live Game Master isn’t going to maintain
the same tone throughout an adventure; there are
times they’ll want to push more action and times
they’ll want to dial it back. The Chaos Factor
shifts throughout your adventure to simulate a

## GM shifting the tempo while running a game.

Since Yes answers to Fate Questions tend to be
more action oriented, they become more and more
likely the higher the Chaos Factor climbs. Higher

## Chaos also means higher chances of Random

Events and a greater likelihood that your Scenes
will start in unexpected ways; these aspects of the

## Chaos Factor are discussed more in the “Random

Events” and “Scenes” chapters, respectively.
Here’s an example of how the Chaos Factor
influences Fate Questions to regulate the
atmosphere of a game:
The Player Character Safrid, a high fantasy
druid, has been exploring a dungeon. Safrid has
handled the dungeon’s various perils well so far,
and the Chaos Factor has fallen to 4.
Suddenly, he comes across a Bog Beast, a truly
terrifying creature! The battle doesn’t go well,
and he retreats, fleeing from the monster to
relative safety. This Scene was a mess for Safrid;
the PC definitely wasn’t in control. The Chaos
Factor goes up to 5.
In the following Scene, as Safrid flees, he runs
afoul of a trap in the dungeon and barely escapes
it with his life. Once again, this is a Scene where

## Safrid had difficulty dealing with trouble. The


## Chaos Factor goes up again to 6.

The higher Chaos Factor means Safrid faces
greater chances of active elements during the
adventure. Is there a trap in this room? Yes. Is
the door locked at the end of the hall? Yes. Is
the Bog Beast still chasing him? Yes. Chaotic
conditions in each Scene encourage more chaotic
conditions in following Scenes, creating a


---

# CHAOS FACTOR VALUES

2222

# FATE QUESTIONS

snowball effect where the tension slowly increases
and the Chaos Factor continues to rise.
Eventually, Safrid gets a handle on things
again. He finds a place to rest; he prepares for
the Bog Beast and defeats it; he finds a potion
that heals some of his wounds. The Character
is facing the challenges of the adventure head-
on and overcoming them. This control over the
adventure reverses the rising tension, and things
calm down as the Chaos Factor falls to 4, 3, and
even 2.
The lower Chaos Factor starts to have the opposite
effect from before: now that things are calm in
the adventure, and the Chaos Factor is low, No
answers to Fate Questions are more common.
When the Character is in control, No answers
tend to be negative for them. Is there treasure in
the chest? No. Does he have any food left? No.

## Now the lower Chaos Factor is working against

Safrid; this encourages the pendulum to start
swinging back the other way, setting the stage for
future challenges that the character may face.
Not every Scene or Fate Question follows
these assumptions exactly, but when you look at
the course of an adventure as a whole they tend
to hold true. The overall result is that the Chaos
Factor shifts the tone of the adventure so you
never get too comfortable or too sure of exactly
how things are going to unfold.

## Using The Fate Chart

You have your Question, you have your Odds,
you know the Chaos Factor; now it’s time to consult
the Fate Chart. Cross reference the determined
Odds with the current Chaos Factor to get the
probability of a Yes answer to your Fate Question.
You’ll notice that the values in the Fate Chart
are expressed with a large central number flanked
by smaller numbers on both sides. The central
number is the percentile chance of a Yes answer.

## Roll 1D100 and compare the result to this value.

If you roll within the value, then the answer is
Yes; if you roll above it, then the answer is No.
By rolling very low or very high you can
achieve Exceptional results. The smaller numbers
to the left and right of the central number
represent the extreme 20% of the Yes and No
ranges, giving you a 1 in 5 chance of a Yes or No
answer being Exceptional. Rolling equal to or
less than the left-hand number is an Exceptional
Yes; rolling equal to or higher than the right-hand
number is an Exceptional No. A value of “X”
means an Exceptional result is not possible with
those Odds.


---

# TO ANSWER YOUR


---

# QUESTION

Mythic will yield one of four responses to
a Fate Question: Yes, No, Exceptional Yes, or
Exceptional No. This gives you four possible
paths of interpretation.
Yes
A Yes response to a Fate Question means the
answer is your Expectation of what a Yes would
mean. This is the most straightforward of the
possible answers and likely won’t require much
interpretation.
The Chaos Factor is a major influence on the
answers to Fate Questions. While this is meant
to vary the tone throughout the adventure, you
can adjust the Chaos Factor’s influence to suit
your tastes. Check out “Choose Your Chaos
Flavor” in the “Variations” chapter on page 147
for variant rules that change how much power
the Chaos Factor exerts.

# QUESTIONABLE CHAOS

2222 2323

# FATE QUESTIONS

“Is the door locked?” Yes, the door is locked.
“Does the black hole begin to suck us in?” Yes,
the black hole is sucking you in. “Is the gladiator
armed with a sword?” Yes, he’s armed with the
kind of sword you’d expect.
No
A No response to a Fate Question means
the answer is the next most Expected outcome
from what a Yes would have meant. With simple
Questions, a No may be the opposite of a Yes and
therefore easy to interpret; a complex Question
might require more interpretative legwork.
“Is the door locked?” No, it’s unlocked. “Does the
black hole begin to suck us in?” No, you’re fine
for now. “Is the gladiator armed with a sword?”
No, he’s armed with a spear.
Exceptional Yes
An Exceptional Yes is the same as a Yes but
intensified, meaning you take your Yes answer to
the next logical level.
“Is the door locked?” Yes, and it’s a darn good
lock. “Does the black hole begin to suck us in?”
Yes, and the stressors are causing damage all
across the ship. “Is the gladiator armed with a
sword?” Yes, a huge greatsword.
Exceptional No
An Exceptional No is the opposite of a Yes
answer. If that would be the same as a regular No,
then it’s the opposite of a Yes intensified.
“Is the door locked?” No, in fact the door is
partially open. “Does the black hole suck us in?”
No, you’re actually moving away from it. “Is
the gladiator armed with a sword?” No, he’s not
armed at all.
Values on the Fate Chart are expressed with a central, large number
showing the percentage chance of a Yes answer. Rolling 1d100 equal
to or less than this number is a Yes answer. Rolling equal to or less
than the number on the left, the lower 20% of the Yes answer range,
is an Exceptional Yes. Rolling above the central number is a No, and
rolling equal to or above the rightmost number is an Exceptional No.
In the cutout above, a roll of 1-10 would be an Exceptional Yes, 11-50
a Yes, 51-90 a No, and 91-100 an Exceptional No.

# FATE QUESTIONS

Random Events
One consequence of asking Fate Questions is
inviting a Random Event to occur. When rolling
d100 to answer your Question, if you get a double
number (11, 22, 33, etc.), and the single value of
that number (1, 2, 3, etc.) is equal to or less than
the current Chaos Factor, then you’ve triggered a
Random Event. We’ll delve more into Random
Events in the next chapter.


---

# THE FATE CHECK

Not everyone likes looking up percentile
values on a table. If you’d rather not use the Fate

## Chart to answer Fate Questions you can skip the

Chart and use a Fate Check instead. You still roll
2d10, but this time you add the dice together
instead of treating them like a percentile. This
method of answering Fate Questions can be
faster than using the Fate Chart and it matches
the Odds fairly closely aside from a higher chance
of Exceptional results.

## Adjust For Odds & Chaos Factor

Like the d100 Fate Chart, a 2d10 Fate Check is
modified based on the current Chaos Factor and
the Odds assigned to a Fate Question. The “Fate

### Check Modifiers” table on the next page breaks

down how the Odds and Chaos Factor affect your
roll results.
For instance, if you asked a Fate Question
with Odds of Very Likely you would apply a +2
modifier to the roll. If the Chaos Factor currently
stood at 4, you would apply another modifier of
-1. Adding both modifiers together gives a final
modifier of +1.

## If your next Fate Question had Odds of Nearly


## Impossible you would get a modifier of -4.

Combined with the Chaos Factor modifier of -1
your total modifier is -5.

## Fate Check Answers


### The “Fate Check Answers” table summarizes

what your roll total means. A modified total of 11
or more is a Yes answer, while a total below 11 is a
No answer.
As with the Fate Chart, rolling very high or
very low will give you an Exceptional answer.  If
the modified total falls within the 18-20 range
then the answer is an Exceptional Yes; if the
total falls within the 2-4 range then the answer
is an Exceptional No. Your final total must fall
somewhere within those ranges to count as an
Exceptional result. A modified roll of 18 is an
Exceptional Yes, while a modified roll of 22 is
a regular Yes. This means modifiers will push
your dice total toward those ranges but may also
cause the total to exceed them, in which case no
Exceptional result occurs.
Interpretation is an important part of the
emulating process. Mythic answers your
Questions, but these answers are merely
prompts for you to make sense of.

## Often interpretations will come easily. If the

Question was, “I open the desk drawer; is there
a gun inside?” then a Yes or a No will be clear.
Sometimes, though, interpretations elude you,
or an answer won’t give you enough to interpret.
If you feel like you need more information you
can try to clarify the answer with another Fate
Question. “Is the gun a pistol?” “Is it loaded?”
Be careful not to fall into the trap of asking for
more detail than you need. A string of narrow,
specific Questions can easily stall the flow of the
game. Unless it’s something important to the
adventure it’s generally best to ask a few “big
picture” Questions and run with your expectations
as far as you can. The goal is to gather just enough
information to move things forward.

# FATE QUESTIONS

Random Events
Random Events are handled the same way with
a Fate Check as they are with the Fate Chart. If
both dice come up as the same number (11, 22,
33, etc.), and the single digit value (1, 2, 3, etc.) is
equal to or less than the Chaos Factor, then you
get a Random Event. As with the Fate Chart, the
result that triggers an Event is still used to answer
your Fate Question as well.

## Safrid the Druid has survived the Dungeon of

Galzarad … so far. Now, in his travels through
a deep, subterranean cavern, he’s come across
a rope bridge suspended over a chasm. Using a
Fate Check, his Player asks the Fate Question,
“Does the bridge look stable?”

## The Player assigns this Question the Odds of


## Nearly Impossible (-4 modifier), and the Chaos

Factor is currently 6 (+1 modifier), resulting in
a final modifier of -3. This means the Player has
to roll at least a 14 to receive a Yes answer.
The Player rolls 2d10 and gets a 3 and a 3. The
rolled total is 6 with a -3 modifier for a final
result of 3. That’s below the target number of
11, so the answer is a No. This result also falls
within the 2-4 range, making it an Exceptional
No. And since a double number was rolled (3
and 3), and 3 is within the CF value of 6, this

## Question also results in a Random Event.

It looks like Safrid may be in for an interesting
time trying to get across that bridge.

# QUESTION THEM

Fate Questions should be asked when you aren’t
sure whether an expectation you have is true. The
more you use Mythic to create adventures the more
you’ll get a feel for when to ask a Fate Question and
when to stick with your expectations.
If you find yourself conflicted, follow your
interests, consider the Context of the adventure,
and listen to your gut. Does it feel right to pose this
detail as a Fate Question, or are you certain enough
to take it for granted?

## As your adventure progresses and develops more

Context Fate Questions and their answers will get
easier and easier to come up with. Much of the
narrative’s richness will come from details that were
fleshed out by prior Fate Questions. Establishing
that a certain NPC is unfriendly will shape your
later expectations about that Character and
might impact the Odds of future Fate Questions
concerning their actions. In this way, a logical
chain of events will build upon itself, shaping the
structure of the adventure and spinning it into a
narrative just like a Game Master would.
Give Me More!
In order to keep things moving in your
adventure a good rule of thumb is to try and limit
yourself to no more than two Fate Questions
for any one detail; that should give you enough
information to reach a reasonable expectation for
just about anything. If you can manage with only
one Question so much the better.
A pair of occult investigators are creeping through
a graveyard at midnight, searching for the walking
dead. They come across a mausoleum and inspect
the entrance to see if it’s been opened recently.
One of the Players asks, “Do we hear anything?”
Mythic says Yes, but the Player doesn’t have a
clear expectation of what is heard.
“We crash land the plane in an open field as safely as
possible. Did it sustain any damage?”
Yes: The plane is damaged but not in any way
that can’t be repaired.
No: The ground was smooth enough that you
were able to roll it to a stop in one piece.
Exceptional Yes: The ground was rough. One
of the wheels came off in a ditch and pitched us
sideways, crumpling a wing as we slammed into
the ground. The plane is an unflyable wreck.
Exceptional No: A perfect touchdown without
any damage. In fact, the plane is well-positioned
for takeoff once you find fuel.
“We succeed in breaking open the vault. Do we find
the vaccine inside?”
Yes: Yes, you do.
No: The vaccine isn’t there.
Exceptional Yes: You find several cases of the
vaccine, many more than you expected.
Exceptional No: You find the broken, ruined
vials of the vaccine—it’s been destroyed.
“We make our way through the woods. Do we
encounter anything today?”
Yes: Yes, now you have to figure out what the
encounter is.
No: All is peaceful.
Exceptional Yes: More than one encounter.
Figure out what the first one is, then once that’s
resolved figure out the second one.
Exceptional No: All is peaceful today and tonight
as well, so there’s no need to check again when
you make camp.

“Does it sound like something scrambling inside
a tomb?” No. “Does it sound like someone
walking through the graveyard?” No. “Does it
sound like something flying through the air?” No.

## The Player is muscling through a run of

No answers in search of a Yes, but they could
have stopped after the second Question (“Does
it sound like something scrambling inside a
tomb?”). They already know that the investigators
hear a noise that isn’t coming from inside the
mausoleum, so a logical expectation at this point
might be that they hear something outside in the
graveyard—perhaps a shuffling sound—or that
they hear something too faint to identify and will
have to investigate further.
After two Questions the Player has enough
information to make a reasonable interpretation
that matches their expectations.

# REPLACE RPG RULES

You can ask any Fate Question during an
adventure, even one that would normally be
handled with the mechanics of your chosen RPG.
If you can’t recall a certain rule or haven’t fully
learned the game, you can use Fate Questions
as an on-the-spot substitute, similar to the “snap
judgements” a live GM might make to save time.
You can assign Odds to these Fate Questions
based on the Context of the adventure and your
current understanding of the RPG’s rules.
The Player is playing a post-apocalyptic game
that has rules for randomly determining details
about any surviving settlements the Player
Character comes across. During an adventure,
the PC encounters a village, but the Player can’t
remember the rules for generating settlements
and they don’t want to stop in the middle of
playing to look them up.
They do remember that the process involves
determining key factors like population size,
technology level, and systems of law and order,
so they take this knowledge of the RPG rules and
turn it into Fate Questions: “Does the village
have a decent size population?” “Do they have
advanced technology?” “Is the village ordered and
So far, this section has focused on using Fate

## Questions to replace “spot rules” in your chosen

RPG, thereby reducing the time you spend
flipping pages in search of a mechanic you can’t
remember. You can take this further by replacing
any rules you don’t feel like using, or you can even
forgo the rules entirely and just use Mythic. This
spectrum from Mythic to mechanics lets you be
flexible with how you play.
For instance, if you wanted to use a chosen
RPG but felt more inspired by its setting than
its actual rules, you could just take the setting
and replace the mechanics with Fate Questions.
But maybe there are some rules in the game
you really like, such as a sanity system or a
cybernetic hacking minigame. These you could
port over as Fate Questions, following the tone
and intent of the original rules but resolving
them with Mythic instead.

## You can also use this approach to learn a new

RPG. Rather than reading it cover to cover, you
can just start playing and replace anything
you don’t understand yet with Fate Questions.
Then, as you learn more of the RPG, you can
incorporate more and more of the game rules
into your adventure.
This is another beautiful thing about solo role-
playing: you have tremendous control over how
you play, not just in the narrative of the adventure
itself but in the meta aspect of what rules you use
and how you use them.

structured?” Once the Player has enough to go on
the PC can begin to interact with the new location.
Later on in the adventure the PC ends up in a
situation where she is at risk of drowning. The
Player can’t remember the rules for determining
whether a character drowns, so to keep things
moving they leave it up to a Fate Question: “Does
the PC start to drown”? They then interpret the
resulting answer and continue playing.

## Exceptional Answers

Mythic’s Fate Questions are intended to
guide the narrative of an adventure and the

## Chaos Factor is there to regulate that narrative.

Questions like “Does the kingdom have harsh
laws?” are narrative, story-oriented Questions; the
answers to them can vary depending on the CF,
and the CF varies depending on what’s happened
in the adventure so far. Past narrative impacts
current narrative.

# FATE QUESTIONS

But when you’re using Fate Questions to
replace the rules of an RPG (combat “to hit”
rules, recovery from damage, task resolution,
etc.), what matters more than the ebb and flow
of narrative tension is consistency. I suggest, in
these cases, that you disregard the current CF and
treat it as a value of 5. This will give those Fate
Questions default, middle of the road percentiles
without the Chaos Factor skewing results.

## You should also consider whether to honor

Exceptional results. Unless you know that the
rule you’re replacing has degrees of success and
failure, it may be best to treat Exceptional results
as regular answers.
The Player has just picked up a new superheroes
role-playing game. They understand enough of
the rules to make a Character, so they decide to
jump right in with a solo Mythic adventure.
During the first Scene, the PC finds themself
in an apparently empty building. They have
a power that allows them to sense when other
people are nearby, but the Player can’t remember
the rules for how to use it. Looking it up would
break the narrative tension, so the Player decides
to pose it as a Fate Question instead: “Do I
successfully use my power to sense if there are
others nearby?”
The Player knows that the PC’s power should be
strong enough to cover the entire building (unless
the building is actually bigger than it looks), so
they decide that the Odds of a Yes are Nearly
Certain. Since this Fate Question is replacing a
rule in their chosen RPG, they ignore the current
Chaos Factor of 7 and treat it as a 5. According
to the Fate Chart, this gives the PC an 85%
chance of successfully using their power.
The Player rolls and gets an 8. With the modifier
from the Odds, this puts the result within the
range of an Exceptional Yes. However, the Player
knows that this RPG doesn’t have degrees of success
for this power—it either works or it doesn’t—so
they treat the answer like a simple Yes.
The power worked; the PC is psychically
scanning the building for the presence of others.
So, do they detect anyone?
Asking a Fate Question to use the power was
done to replace a rule in the RPG. Now that we
know the power succeeded asking if we detect
anyone is a normal, narrative Fate Question.
The Player goes back to using regular Mythic
rules: they ask a Fate Question, “Do I detect
anyone?”, assign it Odds, and allow the Chaos

## Factor of 7 to influence the result.

Another thing you may want to consider
is ignoring Random Events that result from

## Fate Questions used as RPG rules. As with

Exceptional results this may depend on whether
the rule from your chosen RPG has a similar
mechanic that allows for additional consequences.
Ignoring Random Events in these cases are a
judgement call on your part; sometimes it may
make sense to generate the Random Event, and
sometimes it may not.

# THE BIG FATE

QUESTION EXAMPLE:
Henny In Z Land
Let’s put the rules of this chapter into action
with a trip into zombie territory.
In this example, the Player Character is Henny
Lassiter, a barista turned zombie apocalypse
survivor. Henny’s Player is using their favorite
end-of-the-world RPG with Mythic acting as the

## Game Master of their solo adventure campaign.

Henny has already been through a few
adventures: surviving the initial outbreak, escaping
the city, and learning to get by in the wild. In
the current adventure, Henny and her rescued
companion Malcolm have made their way into a
forest in search of shelter, staying alert for zombies.
The Player asks, “Do I see any movement in
the trees ahead?” The current Chaos Factor is
4, and considering how deep in the forest the
Characters are, they figure the Odds of seeing
movement right now are Very Unlikely. This gives
them a 15% chance of a Yes on the Fate Chart.
They roll d100 and get 50, a No. The Player
interprets this to mean that the coast is clear, and
the two Characters continue on.
After what the Player decides is an hour’s worth
of walking, they ask, “Do we find anything useful
along the way?” The forest is on the outskirts of a
city, and Henny and Malcolm have been walking
for some time, so the Player figures the Odds of
coming across something now are Likely. They
check these Odds against the CF of 4 and get a
50% chance on the Fate Chart.
Rolling again, the Player gets 33 for a Yes, with
a possible Random Event since they rolled double
digits (a 3 and a 3). The 3 is equal to or less than
the CF value of 4, so a Random Event does occur.

## The Player thinks about the Yes answer to the

Question first. What they would most expect to
find would be random supplies dropped by people
fleeing the city. In the pandemonium of the mass
exit there would likely be stuff left along the way
that could be useful to others.
The Player next generates the Random Event
(using the rules in the next chapter, which we’ll get
to soon) and interprets the results as Henny and
Malcolm coming across a seemingly abandoned
encampment. This Random Event works well with
the Yes answer to the Fate Question.

## The Player interprets all of this as Henny and

Malcolm discovering an abandoned encampment
in the woods. There are remnants of a fire, a
backpack that’s seen better days, and a torn tent.
The discovery of the camp was interpreted
from the Random Event. For the Question about
finding anything useful, the Player interprets the
Yes answer as the Characters finding a few cans
of food while digging through the abandoned
campsite. Considering they haven’t eaten in over
24 hours finding food is certainly useful.
When interpreting the Yes for the Question of
“Do we find anything useful along the way?”
the Player chose to follow their expectations
for what a Yes means.
If they weren’t sure, they could have tested
this expectation with another Fate Question,
such as “Do we find food?”

## The Player decided to limit this to a single

Question and run with an interpretation
that made the most sense.
Henny and Malcolm continue their trek
through the forest. The day is wearing on; they’ll
need to find shelter before nightfall, when the
temperature will drop drastically.
The Player asks, “Do we find shelter in the
woods before night?” With hours of walking
between now and then the Player decides that
it’s Likely for them to find shelter of some kind
in that time. With the Chaos Factor at 4 the
percentile chance of a Yes is 50%.
The Player rolls and gets 9. Not only is that a
Yes it’s an Exceptional Yes since it falls within the
3030 3131


---

# FATE QUESTIONS

lower 20% of the Yes range (for Odds of 50%, that
would be a roll of 10 or less). The Player interprets
this to mean that as the sun begins to dip towards
the horizon Henny and Malcolm spot a two-story
house, a full domicile, nestled deep among the
trees. This is a wonderful find! Not only will it
give them shelter for the night but there might be
all kinds of supplies and goods inside.
The two cautiously approach the house, wary
of any lurking zombies or fellow survivors looking
to protect what’s theirs. Henny takes a deep
breath and tries the door to see if it’s locked.
The Player asks, “Is the door locked?” but has
to think about the Context for a moment to try
and come up with Odds. Henny and Malcolm are
several weeks into a zombie apocalypse, and the
area has been mostly evacuated. However, this is a
nice house so anyone still around would probably
have sought shelter here just like Henny and
Malcolm are trying to.

## The Player isn’t sure of the Odds to this


## Question so they go with 50/50. With the Chaos

Factor at 4 the chance of a Yes is 35%. They roll a
92, an Exceptional No. The Player interprets this
to mean that not only is the door unlocked but
the house inside is in excellent shape. A valuable
find. Henny and Malcolm step inside.
Using Odds of 50/50 are good for when you
think the chances of something are about
even, but also when you have no idea what
the Odds for something should be.
Since the Exceptional result calls for
intensifying the answer the Player follows their
expectation for what that means in this situation.
Not only is the door to the house unlocked, the
interior is well stocked with food and goods and
even has running water and electricity. Whoever
lived here evacuated quickly, taking only essentials
and leaving everything else. It appears that Henny
and Malcolm are the first people to come across
the place since the outbreak began.

Random Events
M
ythic adventures may be guided by your
Questions and expectations to maintain
narrative congruence, but they’re also
filled with plenty of action that comes at us from
out of the blue. No matter how you think a
situation will unfold, Mythic can always step in to
take things in a new and unexpected direction.

## These interjections are called Random Events.

They’re Mythic’s way of adding a dimension of
surprise to your adventure, resulting in plot twists
you might never have seen coming.
Random Events can occur at two points during
a Mythic adventure: when a Fate Question is
asked and when a Scene is first generated (see the
“Scenes” chapter for more information).

## Random Events From

Fate Questions
Whenever you ask a Fate Question, there
is always the possibility of a Random Event
occurring. When rolling 1d100 for the Fate Chart
(or 2d10 for a Fate Check), if you get a double
number (11, 22, 33, etc.) whose digit (1 for 11,
2 for 22, etc.) is equal to or less than the Chaos
Factor, then a Random Event occurs. So if you
rolled a 55 while answering a Fate Question, and
the Chaos Factor was 8, then a Random Event
would take place, but if the Chaos Factor was 3,
then there would be no Random Event.

## Random Events From


## Interrupted Scenes

An Interrupted Scene is a twist that derails
your expectations about what will happen next to
create a new, surprise Scene.

## Mythic adventures are broken into cinematic


## Scenes that are generated from your expectations.

At the beginning of each Scene you decide how
you think that Scene will begin and then roll
to see if you are correct. Sometimes the Scene
will begin as expected; sometimes it will be
changed slightly; and sometimes a Random

## Event will create an entirely new and unexpected

Scene called an Interrupt Scene. This process is
described more fully in the “Scenes” chapter.

# TYPES OF RANDOM EVENTS

3434 3535


---

# GENERATING


---

# RANDOM EVENTS

Once a Random Event has been triggered you
need to figure out what happens. There are two
components to a Random Event: Event Focus and
Event Meaning. Both of these components are
interpreted through the lens of Context. Interpret
those elements together to get your final result.


---

# CONTEXT

Context includes everything that’s happened
in the adventure up to this point. It is the
backdrop that should be taken into account when
interpreting any Random Event.
If the Player Character is a spy sneaking
through an enemy stronghold in search of stolen
plans for a military satellite, Random Events
should be interpreted with this setting in mind.
If an Event indicates that something negative
happens to the PC, then perhaps they are spotted
by a guard or drop their gun down a stairwell.
The Fate Question or tested Scene that
prompted the Event also counts as Context. If
your Fate Question was “Does the guard hear me
approach?”, and you generate a Random Event,
then the Event itself may have something to do
with the guard.
Keeping Context in mind will help you make
the logical leap toward resolving the Event in a
satisfying manner.


---

# EVENT FOCUS

When a Random Event is triggered you need to
establish where the action of the Event is focused.

## This is done by rolling 1d100 on the Random


### Event Focus Table. The result will point to an

aspect of your adventure. For instance, the Event
might directly affect a Player Character, or it
might introduce a new Non-Player Character.

### Here’s what all the table results mean:


---

# GENERATING RANDOM EVENTS

3636


---

# RANDOM EVENTS


---

# REMOTE EVENT

A Remote Event means that something has
happened that your Character wasn’t present
for; they’re only learning about it now. This can
happen in many ways.
Maybe the Player Character encounters
the dead body of an NPC they met earlier in
the adventure, and the Remote Event is this
Character’s death, which the PC did not directly
witness. Or maybe the PC wanders into a tavern
and learns by word of mouth that the enemy
horde has advanced, destroying the next town
down the road.
Remote Events are a way of introducing new
twists into an adventure without the PC being
directly involved with them.


---

# AMBIGUOUS EVENT


### Most of the Event Focus Table results give you

a clear indication of what the Event is about. NPC

## Action means that an NPC does something; PC

Positive means whatever that happens is good for
the Player Character. Maybe a Thread is being
closed, or maybe a new NPC enters the adventure.
Whatever it is, its impact on the adventure is clear.
An Ambiguous Event, however, is purposefully
vague. It’s something that happens which is
neither harmful nor helpful, at least not initially.
The PC in a zombie apocalypse adventure is
exploring an abandoned building in search
of useful items or food. Suddenly, they hear
something from the floor above: a bumping
and scraping, followed by rhythmic thumps
that might be footsteps. Is it a zombie? Another
survivor? Maybe it’s someone who can help them,
or maybe it’s just the wind blowing through an
open window. The PC doesn’t know.
An Ambiguous Event can be interpreted in
several different ways. Perhaps the Event is vague,
and you won’t know whether it’s good or bad
until you check it out, like in the example above.
This makes an Ambiguous Event an opportunity
to explore.
Or perhaps the Ambiguous Event is a new
element in your adventure that doesn’t make
sense now but might make sense later. If your
PC comes across a photo of several people while
exploring an empty house, is this photo a clue
related to what you’re searching for, or is it just a
random photo with no relevance to your mission?
Only time will tell.

# RANDOM EVENTS

In the examples above, the Ambiguous Events
don’t say anything about the narrative. A random
sound, a photo—these are details that may or
may not expand into something meaningful
later on in the adventure. They might turn out
to be significant, or they might turn out to be
red herrings or bits of ambiance. Interpreting an
Ambiguous Event doesn’t require you to figure
out what it means; you just have to leave yourself
open to the possibilities.
Ambiguous Events can easily turn into
narrative foreshadowing. Maybe those animal
sounds your PC heard in the woods are the
passage of small creatures they’ll soon encounter.
Maybe that photo you found will come in
handy later when you run afoul of a ghost in the
house. Keep those ambiguous details in mind in
case they fit with future Context and help you
interpret later events.
The PC encounters a man in town he recognizes
from the photo he found in the house. After some
detective work, the PC discovers that the man
killed his own cousin, who is now haunting the
mansion. This turn of events—discovering the
murderer of the ghost—would not have been
possible without first having the Ambiguous
Event with the photo.


---

# NEW NPC

A new Non-Player Character enters the
adventure. This new Character plays a role in
the current Scene and will likely be added to the

## Characters List when the Scene is over.

The PC in a sword-and-sorcery fantasy game
is exploring a dungeon. In a Scene where she’s
checking out a room, the Player gets a Random
Event with a New NPC, which they determine
to be a giant mutated rat. After a short battle,
the Player realizes that there are likely more of
these rats in the dungeon, so they add “Giant
mutant rats” to the Characters List.


---

# NPC ACTION

An existing Non-Player Character does
something that impacts the adventure. Roll on
the Characters List to see which NPC acts for
this Event.
The PC, a zombie apocalypse survivor, is trying
to find antibiotics for a sick friend. She’s just
discovered a pharmacy, and searching through it
is the basis for this Scene.

## As the PC cautiously enters the building, the


## Player asks a Fate Question that generates a


## Random Event with the Focus of NPC Action.


## They roll on the Characters List and get “Dillard

Gang”, a violent group the PC encountered in an
earlier Scene that the Player subsequently added

### The results of the Event Focus Table are specific

about what aspect of the adventure the Random
Event is centered around: Player Characters,
NPCs, something bad, something good, and so
on. However, just because the table indicates
what element the Event includes doesn’t mean
it has to be the only element. There’s plenty of
overlap between results.
For instance, you might generate a PC Positive.

## Yay! Something good just happened to your

Character, finally. Maybe the good thing that
happened is you gained an ally, someone who will
help you accomplish your goals.
Well, hold on. Wouldn’t that be a Move Toward A

## Thread or New NPC?

Yes, it would be. You could have rolled any of
those for an Event Focus and come up with the
same interpretation. Whatever Event Focus you
roll is not meant to limit you; it’s simply meant
to be a starting place that helps you interpret
the final result. If that result includes multiple
elements from your adventure, then all the better.

to the List. The Player determines that a member
of the gang is lurking in the store and ambushes
the PC as she approaches the pharmacy counter.

## NPC/PC NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE


## Something bad or good happens to a Player

Character or Non-Player Character, depending on
which result you got on the Event Focus Table.
If the Event calls for a PC, determine which
PC it is. If you’re playing solo with a single Player
Character then this Event is automatically about
them; if there is more than one Player Character,
then choose the one you would most expect this
Event to apply to.
If the Event calls for a Non-Player Character,
roll on the Characters List to determine which
Character it is.

## Negative and Positive outcomes of this

Random Event can run a gamut of possibilities
depending on the Context of the adventure
and how you interpret the result. The Positive
or Negative Event can be something story-
shifting and important, or it can be something
minor, as long as you think it’s the most expected
interpretation of your results.
An occult investigator PC is trying to rid a
manor house of an angry, powerful ghost, but it
isn’t going well. During a Scene where the PC
is trying to banish the ghost with magic, Mythic
generates a Random Event with a Focus of PC
Negative. The Player is playing the game solo but
controlling two Player Characters—the primary
investigator Nigel and his assistant Clara—so
they have to choose which of them this Event
pertains to. They decide that Nigel is probably
the target of the Event since he’s the one casting
the spell.
The Player interprets this Event to mean that the
ghost exerts tremendous supernatural force and
pulls the entire house into a nightmare realm
where reality is shifting and uncertain.
If a Random Event calls for a New NPC but you
have no idea who or what it could be asking a

## Fate Question or two can help you figure it out.

Alternatively, you can use an Element Meaning

### Table.


### There are Element Meaning Tables for all kinds

of things pertaining to NPCs: what they look like,
how they act, their background, their motivation,
what they say, and more. You can pick and choose
which tables seem most pertinent in the moment
and use them to get to know the new Character
that was just
introduced into
your adventure.

In a later Scene, Nigel and Clara are trying to
break down the door to the room where the angry
ghost originally died. They believe that this room
contains a family painting that’s serving as the
ghost’s anchor to the house, and that if they can
destroy it they’ll be returned to the normal world.
Mythic generates another Random Event during
this Scene, this time with a Focus of NPC
Positive. Rolling on the Characters List, the
Player gets Warren, the gardener and caretaker
of the mansion whom the PCs met in an earlier
Scene but haven’t seen for some time. Up until
now the Player assumed that Warren must
have met an unpleasant end somewhere on the
property. They interpret this Event to mean that

## Warren comes running up the hall after hearing

Nigel and Clara’s attempt to break into the
room. The “positive” for Warren in this case is
that he’s still alive. Maybe he’ll also be of help in
getting this door open …

# MOVE TOWARD A THREAD


## Threads are the goals and missions that the

Player Character is pursuing. This Random Event
brings the PC one step closer to resolving an open
Thread. Roll on the Threads List to see which
Thread the Event involves.
The Player Character is a pulp era treasure
hunter exploring an ancient pyramid. During
this exploration, the Player runs into a Random
Event and gets Move Toward A Thread, with
the Thread being “Find the ancient tomb of
Ank-Tonen.”
The Player determines that the PC comes across a
wall inscribed with a crude map of the pyramid
complex, at the center of which is a symbol that
can only be the tomb itself. This is a major clue
for the PC: it shows her exactly how to get to
where she wants to go!
Generating Random Events in Mythic is,
well, random. Any NPC you’ve placed on the
Characters List can turn up if the Event Focus
calls for it. But what do you do when the
Character called upon couldn’t possibly be there
for that Scene?
When an NPC is invoked for a Random Event,
it doesn’t necessarily mean that the Character
themself is present and active, just that the Event
involves them in some way.
For instance, in the example on the previous
page, the survivor PC is searching a pharmacy
for antibiotics when the Player rolls a Random

## Event with a Focus of NPC Action that invokes the

Dillard Gang. In that case it makes sense that a
member of the group would be physically present
in the store to cause problems for the PC.
But what if the Player got the same Event Focus
result later in the adventure when the PC
was flying in a small airplane? Here are a few
interpretations that would make sense:
 » The pilot has been friendly and helpful up to
this point, even offering to fly the PC to a safe
place. But now she notices a tattoo on his
wrist, the same tattoo that the other Dillards
have. He’s one of them! The NPC Action in
this case is that he’s lying to the PC about
who he is and what he’s doing.
 » En route to the PCs destination, the pilot picks
up radio chatter from a settlement below.
They’re being attacked by the Dillard Gang!
 » While relaxing on the plane the PC checks
through her backpack to see what supplies
she has left. To her dismay, the Dillards must
have gotten their hands on it during her most
recent clash with them because all of her
ammo is gone.
BUT, THEY’RE NOT HERE

# MOVE AWAY FROM A THREAD


## While the previous Random Event helps the


## Player Character get closer to resolving an open

Thread, this Event does the opposite: it represents a
new hurdle or setback that hinders the PC’s progress
toward closing a Thread. Roll on the Threads List
to see which Thread the Event involves.
The Player Character, a hired mercenary, is
tracking a criminal through the jungle when
a Random Event comes up with the Event
Focus of Move Away from a Thread, in this
case, “Capture the escaped criminal”. The
Player interprets this to mean that the trail has
disappeared and there is no sign of the criminal.
No tracks in the mud, no broken branches,
nothing. The PC must double back to find the
trail again, losing valuable time in their pursuit.
The Event should make resolving the Thread
more difficult but not necessarily impossible; the
elimination of a Thread is handled with the next
result on the table or through normal role-play.

# CLOSE A THREAD

This Random Event brings about the closure of
an open Thread. Roll on the Threads List to see
which Thread this involves.
Determining how the Thread is closed will
require interpretation, but whatever the Event is
it should either resolve the Thread or nullify it
somehow.
Nigel and Clara, the occult investigators, have
succeeded in returning the mansion back to the
normal world, but they still need to banish the
ghost, find Warren (who‘s disappeared again),
and find the spell that summoned the enraged
ghost in the first place.
While Nigel is rummaging in the cellar, Mythic
generates a Random Event with the Focus of
Close a Thread. The Player rolls “Find Warren”
on the Threads List and interprets this to mean
that Nigel hears knocking sounds coming from
a large, locked chest. When he opens it Warren
pops out, gasping for breath. The ghost locked
him in the chest to get rid of him for good. With
that goal resolved, the Player removes “Find
Warren” from the Threads List.
In another Scene, while consulting with a mage,
Nigel is informed that tampering with the spell
that summoned the ghost would only strengthen
its power. He had hoped it would help them
banish the ghost but now he knows there’s no
point in looking for it. The Player removes “Find
the spell” from the Threads List.

# CURRENT CONTEXT

Whatever is happening in the Scene right now
becomes the Focus for this Event. If the Random
Event was generated from a Fate Question
then use the Context of the Fate Question as
the Focus. If the Random Event was triggered
as a Scene Interrupt then the Event is directly
related to whatever is currently going on in your
adventure. A Random Event with a Focus of
Current Context takes whatever is going on and
adds a new layer to it.
The Player’s gunslinger PC bursts into a barn,
expecting to find the bandit he’s been pursuing.
The Player asks the Fate Question, “Is he in
here?” Mythic comes back with a No and a

### The Random Event Focus Table has three entries

pertaining to Threads, including Close A Thread, but
no New Thread. Characters have a New NPC entry,
so why don’t Threads have one as well?
There is no New Thread result because the Threads
you follow are decided by you, not the adventure.
Mythic will present you with opportunities and
ideas for goals to pursue, but it is your choice
whether to make any of them a priority.

# RANDOM EVENTS


### Random Event. The Event Focus Table comes

back with Current Context.
The Player thought this might be a big moment
in the adventure—capturing the bandit—but
they were wrong. This unexpected letdown is the
Context right now and this Random Event will
have something to do with that. Depending on
the Event Meaning generated, maybe the PC
finds a taunting message scrawled on the wall or
discovers a bedroll in the corner indicating the
bandit had been here but moved on.

## Choosing The Event Focus

When a Random Event is generated you don’t
always have to roll on the Event Focus Table. If you
have a good idea of what the Event Focus should be
you can choose that result instead of rolling.
The PC, a space adventurer, is in a tight,
dramatic spot: caught in a phaser battle in the
engine room while the warp drive is spiraling toward
a meltdown. The Player asks a Fate Question
that generates a Random Event, but with so much
already going on having an Event introduce a brand

# RANDOM EVENTS

new and potentially unconnected element into
the Scene would be more cumbersome than
helpful. The Player decides to skip rolling for
the Event Focus and instead chooses Current
Context to ensure that this Random Event
will have something to do with the phaser
battle or the engine crisis.


---

# WHEN TO CHOOSE


---

# THE FOCUS

There are circumstances in an adventure
where choosing the Event Focus may make
more sense than rolling for it. For instance,
in the example above the Player was
concerned a new wrinkle in the adventure
would disrupt the current Scene so they
chose Current Context to have a Random

## Event that clicked with what was going on.


### The Choosing The Event Focus Table

gives some situations where you might want
to choose a specific Event Focus.
How often you choose instead of roll
is your choice as well. If you want to have
more narrative control over your adventure
you may choose frequently or always. If
you want a game with more surprises you
may choose rarely or never.
If you want a middle ground approach
that allows some limited choice then give
yourself one choice every five Scenes. This
means you can choose any result on the

### Event Focus Table for one Random Event

within any span of five Scenes. Once spent
you have to wait until the next span of five

## Scenes begins before you get a choice again.

The Player above with the space adventurer
was in Scene 4 of their adventure. They
hadn’t chosen an Event Focus yet so the
option was available. After choosing the
Focus for that Event the Player won’t have
the option to choose again until Scene 6
through 10, then again at 11 through 15,
16 through 20, and so on.

# RANDOM EVENTS

Empty List

## If you don’t have anything on your Threads or

Characters List—perhaps the adventure has only
just begun—then some results from the Event

### Focus Table won’t be usable for you. When the


### Event Focus Table calls for an element from an

empty List ignore the roll and treat the Current

## Context as the Event Focus instead.

In an adventure set during a futuristic world
war, the PC is slowly moving through the snow
down a bombed-out street, staying behind cover
as much as possible while she searches for activity
in the area. The Player asks the Fate Question,
“Does she see anyone?”

## Mythic comes back with Yes and a Random


### Event. The Player rolls on the Event Focus Table

and gets NPC Negative, but this is the first Scene
of the adventure and the Characters List is empty.

## Since this Event Focus isn’t possible, Current


## Context becomes the Focus instead.


---

# LISTS AS


---

# RANDOM TABLES

Lists are updated during the Bookkeeping phase
at the end of a Scene (discussed in the “Scenes”
chapter). This is when you decide which Characters
in the Scene were important enough to add to the
Characters List and if anything stands out as a goal
you may want to add to the Threads List.

### The two Lists act as random tables used for

Random Events. Each List is broken up into 5
sections of 5 lines each. When you add to a List
you start at the top and make your way down
line by line. When you’ve filled one section of 5
elements and go on to the next that new section is
now activated and becomes part of the active List.
There are two columns of numbers on the
left of each List: rolling for the first column
determines which active section of the List to use,
and the second column determines which element
in that active section is chosen.
The first roll is determined by how many
sections of the List are active. If you have up to 5
elements on your List then you don’t roll for the
first column, you are only dealing with the first
section of the List (lines 1-5).

## Get off the island


## Find missing crew


## Find mystical stone

Tocky McAdams

## Bertha The Angry Avian

Jungle
Dinosaurs
If a Random Event calls for an NPC you don’t have to roll for the section
of the Characters List with this List, only the first section has any elements
in it. The player would just roll a 1d10 to determine which element is
invoked. A roll of 6, for example, would indicate “Jungle”.

## Get off the island


## Find missing crew


## Find mystical stone

Tocky McAdams

## Bertha The Angry Avian

Jungle
Dinosaurs
Active volcano

## Minga the lizard man


## Unknown survivor


## A few Scenes later the Characters List is more built up. When a Random

Event happens now that calls for an NPC the player must roll a d4 to
determine which section to use since there are now elements in the
second section on lines 6 and 7. A roll of 3 on the d4 and a roll of 1 on the
d10 would result in “Minga the lizard man” being selected.

# RANDOM EVENTS

If you have 6-10 elements you roll a d4, 11-15
elements is a d6, 16-20 elements is a d8, and 21-
25 elements is a d10.
When a Random Event requires you to roll on
a Threads or Characters List use the number of
active sections to determine which die to use then
roll to see which section this Event will use.
Once you know the section roll a 1d10 and
compare it to the second column of numbers
to determine which line in that section is being
invoked.
If you roll a line that has a Thread or Character
written on it then that Thread or Character is being
called upon by the Random Event. When you roll
a line that is empty of an element the result is
considered Choose. You have two options:
 » CHOOSE AN ELEMENT: Select an
element recorded on the List that makes
the most sense in the current Context.
 » CHOOSE TO ROLL AGAIN: If you
would rather be surprised then roll again
until you get an active element on the List.
The chances of rolling Choose will vary
throughout the adventure from zero chance (when
the active boxes in your List are full) to likely
(when an active box only has one element in it).
The more full your List gets the more rare Choose
will become.

# EVENT MEANING


## You know the Context in which the Random


## Event is taking place and you know what its

Focus will be. An interpretation may already be
forming, but it needs more. It needs a spark of
life. It needs Meaning.

### Mythic uses Meaning Tables to generate a

pair of words that you use as inspiration to help
interpret a Random Event. Generating the Event

## Meaning involves rolling 1d100 twice on an Event


### Meaning Table to get two words. You pair these

words together and use their combined meaning
to suggest interpretations for your Event.
In our war example the Player knows the Focus
of the Random Event (Current Context), so they
roll on an Event Meaning Table and get the
words “Attach” and “Lies”.
After considering the Context of the adventure
and the Fate Question that generated the Event,
the Player makes this interpretation: as the PC
ducks behind a burnt-out car, she sees someone
tacking a sign to the wall of a building (Attach).
It’s a propaganda poster (Lies); this must be a
soldier from the Ministry of Information.

## Meanings To Choose From


### Event Meaning Tables come in three varieties:

Actions, Descriptions, and Elements.

## The Actions and Descriptions Meaning


### Tables each have a set of two d100 tables, while

the numerous Elements Meaning Tables each
have a single, specialized d100 table. You can
find the Actions and Descriptions Meaning

### Tables, as well as the three most general Elements


### Meaning Tables, on the next few pages. For more

specialized Elements Meaning Tables visit the
“Scenes” chapter on page 84.

### Before rolling, choose the Meaning Table that

seems most appropriate for the current Event. You
really can’t go wrong with any of them—they all
On the Adventure Lists there’s a number to the
right of each element slot listing the element
lines from 1 to 25. That’s there to give you a quick
reference for the current count of your Thread
and Character elements.

## The numbers are also helpful if you’re using The


## Adventure Crafter with Mythic and want to use

Mythic’s Adventure Lists. For more information
about combining The Adventure Crafter and
Mythic see page 171.

# RANDOM EVENTS

provide a starting point for interpretation—but
choosing a table that more closely matches the
Context of the Event gives you a better chance of
getting results that are easier to interpret.
The Player’s sci-fi PC has successfully fixed the
ship’s engine, avoiding a devastating meltdown.
As they wrap up repairs and check on other
damage to the ship Mythic generates a Random
Event. The Player rolls a Focus of PC Negative,
indicating that something bad is about to happen
to the PC. That sounds active, so the Player rolls
on the Actions Meaning Tables.
Later in the adventure the PC leads a team
to the surface of a newly discovered planet.
It’s possible to get the same result twice when
rolling on the Elements Meaning Tables. In this
case, consider that word “doubled down” and
interpret it with greater intensity than you would
have otherwise.
For instance, let’s say your PC is searching
through an alien starship when they come to a
closed door. You ask a Fate Question: “Is the door
locked?” Mythic says No and triggers a Random

## Event with a Focus of PC Positive.

You reason that the Event has something to do
with what’s beyond the door, so you use the

### Location Element Meaning Table to get your

Meaning, rolling “Open” and “Extravagant”. You
might interpret this as finding a room full of
gizmos and fancy tech built into the walls with
windows looking out into space.
If you had instead rolled “Open” and “Open”, you
might describe the room as a platform jutting
out into open space, surrounded by a clear force
field—truly open in the most extreme way you
can think of.

## While they’re exploring Mythic triggers another

this new Character is doing? After thinking it
over they change their mind and decide to roll on
the Character Element Meaning Table, which is
more applicable to creating a new Character.

# ROLLING FOR MEANING


## Both the Actions and the Descriptions


### Meaning Tables are made up of two tables,

each with 100 results. To determine the Event

### Meaning roll 1d100 on the first table and again

on the second table. This will give you a word
from each table to pair together.

### The Elements Meaning Tables are each a single

d100 table; roll 1d100 twice on your chosen table
to get a word pair.

### Whichever table you got them from, this pair

of words will help inspire your interpretation of
the Random Event.
The Event Focus is New NPC and the Player
has chosen to use the Descriptions Meaning

### Tables to get an idea of what this NPC looks

like. They roll “Calmly” and “Mundane”. The

## Player might interpret this to mean that the

Character looks like every other traveler passing
through this space station, just calmly going
about their business.
If the Player had rolled “Roughly” and
“Bizarre” on the Descriptions Meaning Tables
they might have interpreted this to mean that
the NPC is a strange-looking alien, and a
rough-looking one at that. Maybe they’re a
bounty hunter with insect-like features wearing
battle scarred armor.

# INTERPRETING

# THE EVENT


## Mythic provides the foundation for your

Random Event: the Event Focus tells you what
aspect of the adventure to turn your attention
to, the Event Meaning suggests details, and the
Context of the adventure gives you a background
of previous events to draw from.
Now it’s up to you to determine how it all fits
together.

### With multiple Meaning Tables to choose from,

how do you know you’re selecting the right one
for your Random Event? It comes down to a
matter of taste: every table gives useful results,
but each of them gives slightly different results.

### Actions Meaning Tables


### The Actions Meaning Tables give word pairs

associated with active narrative elements. These
tables are best used to find out what someone or
something is doing or having done to them. For
instance, if a Random Event involved something
negative happening to an NPC then you could roll
on the Actions Meaning Tables to get an idea of
what occurred.

### Descriptions Meaning Tables


### The Descriptions Meaning Tables give descriptive

word pairs that are useful for deciding what
something or someone looks like. For instance, if
the Random Event involved the introduction of a
new NPC you could use the Descriptions Meaning

### Tables to determine their appearance.


### Elements Meaning Tables


### The Elements Meaning Tables are themed,

giving more targeted results. The most general

### Element Meaning Tables are Location, Character,

and Object; the Element Meaning Tables in the
“Scenes” chapter are even more specialized with
options such as Character Personality, Scavenging
Results, and Dungeon Traps.

# RANDOM EVENTS


## The Lens Of Expectation

Just as your expectations guide your
interpretation of Fate Questions, they also guide
your interpretation of Random Events. When you
combine the Context with the Event Focus and
Event Meaning, whatever your gut tells you this
all means is your expectations speaking to you.
The Player Character is a wandering barbarian
in a medieval setting. Earlier in the adventure,
the PC undertook a quest to bring a fugitive to
justice. His search brought him to a forest village
and he’s decided to rest there for a while, doing
chores in exchange for room and board.
As he heads to the river to fetch water his Player
asks the Fate Question, “Is there anyone else at
the river?” The answer comes back No, but the
roll also generates a Random Event.

### The Player rolls on the Event Focus Table and

gets a Focus of Move Toward A Thread. They
have one Thread on the List: “Capture the
fugitive”. Whatever this Random Event ends up
being the Player knows it’s going to help the PC
in his quest.
For the Event Meaning the Player decides it makes
the most sense to roll on the Actions Meaning

### Tables because it seems like something active is

going to happen. They get “Lure” and “Interior”.
Given the Context, the Event Focus, and the Event
Meaning, a number of ideas spring to mind:
 » While fetching water the PC discovers
footprints in the muck that match the
fugitive’s. The tracks lead to a cave near
the river.
 » The PC spots a makeshift hut in the woods
beyond the river. Perhaps the fugitive used it
for shelter; he might even be inside it now!
 » While fetching water the PC is approached
by a villager who invites him inside her
home so they can talk about something,
which turns out to be related to the fugitive.
All three interpretations are valid because they
all try to make sense of the Event Meaning
word pair, “Lure” and “Interior”. But which is
the best interpretation?
The first one, the PC finding tracks, could
be considered the most logical and expected
interpretation. The second one, finding a hut,
is possible but unlikely, certainly less likely than
finding tracks. The same is true for the third
interpretation, though it may be more expected
than finding the hut.
There is no wrong answer when it comes
to interpretations, but you should allow your
expectations to help you choose what makes the
most sense in the moment.

## You Need More Information

If the Event Meaning doesn’t give you enough
information to spark an interpretation, or if you
get stuck trying to come up with one, you can
always ask a Fate Question or two to narrow
down your options. For instance, the Player of the
medieval barbarian in the example above might
Interpretation of Mythic prompts (Fate Question
answers, Meaning Table results, etc.) is more art
than science. You may encounter struggles such
as getting past the literal meaning of the prompts
or coming up with an idea you’re happy with.
My advice is to listen to your gut and trust
yourself. Open your mind, and don’t treat the
prompt like it defines your interpretation. Instead,
see the prompt for what it is: a starting point from
which you can take your interpretation anywhere
that’s fun and makes sense to you.

ask the Fate Question, “Do I find the fugitive’s
footprints in the mud?”

## Keep in mind that the Event Focus and Event

Meaning are inspirational prompts that don’t
have to be followed to the letter. As long as it fits
within a reasonable expectation, feel free to go
with any interpretation that makes sense, even if
it means stretching the Event Meaning a little.
While the PC is exploring the wreckage of a
starship on an alien planet, Mythic generates a
Random Event with a Focus of New NPC. To
find out what the new NPC is doing, the Player
rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables and gets
“Attack” and “Needs”.
A literal interpretation of this Meaning might
indicate that the NPC is attacking something
they need, but the Player could also abstract
the prompts and interpret the NPC as a
malfunctioning robot that’s attempting to break
into (“Attack”) a storage locker to replace its
dwindling energy cells (“Needs”).


---

# MINING FOR MEANING


## Another way to figure out what a Random

Event means when you’re stuck for an
interpretation is to do another Meaning roll to
see what additional information an extra pair
of words suggests to you. You can use the same

### Meaning Table you used for the Event or a

different one if it seems more appropriate.
The Player in the above example still isn’t sure
what to do with this Event Meaning, “Attack”
and “Needs”. It could be a robot banging away
on a storage locker, but that interpretation just
isn’t sitting right.

## The Player jumps to the Characters Elements


### Meaning Table for more inspiration and rolls

the words “Fast” and “Official”. These seem to
reinforce the initial interpretation with a few
added details. The Player interprets this result to
mean that the NPC is indeed a robot breaking
CONTEXT: The Player Character is a vampire
cruising a nightclub in search of your next meal.
EVENT FOCUS:  NPC Positive; the NPC is a
random human.
EVENT MEANING:  Triumph & Friend
INTERPRETATION: The human is sitting alone
in a secluded part of the club. The perfect
time to approach … but then his friends arrive;
apparently, he was waiting for them. Now he’s
in a group and much harder to feed on without
drawing attention.
CONTEXT: The PC is an old west gambler
stumbling through a graveyard at night when the
dead begin to rise.
EVENT FOCUS:  NPC Action; the NPC is the town
sheriff.
EVENT MEANING:  Abandon & People
INTERPRETATION: With all the PC’s whoopin’
and hollerin’ as the zombies claw out of the
ground, the sheriff comes running to see what’s
going on. He takes one look at the rising dead,
screams, and runs away.
CONTEXT: You’re a smuggler piloting your ship
through space when you get stopped by an
Imperial cruiser that wants to board and search
you.
EVENT FOCUS: Move Toward A Thread; the
Thread is “Deliver the rebel commander to her
secret base”.
EVENT MEANING: Attain & Business
INTERPRETATION: While you scramble for
a lie to tell them over the comms, the rebel
commander hands you a code she says is a valid
shipping license. You send it to the Imperial patrol
and they let you go, seemingly satisfied.
CONTEXT: You’re a magic-based superhero
investigating the crash site of a meteor.
EVENT FOCUS: PC Positive
EVENT MEANING: Trust & Possessions
INTERPRETATION: Your magic-detecting amulet
begins to glow, indicating that whatever was in
that meteor was mystical in nature.

# THE BIG RANDOM

EVENT EXAMPLE:
Weird Times At
Wutwo Labs
This example takes place in a contemporary
adventure using an RPG that’s all about sciencey
weirdness and strange tales. The Player Character
is Dyson McGrew, a security guard at Wutwo
Labs. Dyson never knew what the scientists
were making at the facility until the day their
experiments went haywire and brought on what
might be the end of life as we know it.
Dyson’s adventure begins ten stories
underground, where the errant experiment
exploded. The release of potent radiation and a
noxious gas cloud has led to mutations and the
warping of reality throughout Level 10 and above.
Dyson is fighting his way through the dangers
to get all the way up to the ground floor, Level
1, where he hopes to initiate Protocol WWZero,
an emergency failsafe that would lock down the
entire facility and keep the horrors contained
from an innocent and vulnerable world.
So far in the adventure, Dyson has had to
contend with spiders mutated to monstrous size,
random portals to a Doom Dimension that let
in the occasional interdimensional imp, fellow
workers of Wutwo Labs who will do anything
to survive and get the heck out of there, and
the endless search for security key cards needed
to access doors and make his way ever upward
toward sunlight and freedom.
In this Scene, Dyson has finally reached the
stairwell that leads to Level 9. He has his security
baton for a weapon and the battered door of a cola
vending machine for a shield. With him is Sandra
Copenhagen, a Wutwo scientist who is also trying
to get out. She’s letting Dyson use her security
clearance cards in exchange for his protection.

## Random Events add twists and turns to your


## Mythic Adventure that aren’t the direct result of

Fate Questions. Sometimes, interpretation will
come quickly and easily; other times, it may be
more difficult.
If you find yourself well and truly stuck when
interpreting a Random Event, and clarifying Fate
Questions or additional Meaning words aren’t
helping, feel free to invoke the “I Dunno” Rule.
The I Dunno Rule is a way of saying that it’s okay to
let the Random Event drop and just move on with
your adventure. If no interpretations are coming
to mind, or the Random Event just isn’t making
sense, then forget about it and proceed as though
you never rolled it. Continue your adventure rather
than hold it up.
Be careful not to overdo the I Dunno Rule. There’s a
difference between taking forever to come up with
the perfect interpretation and taking a moment to
craft something workable. It’s easy to overthink the
results of Random Events; I suggest you go with the
first thing that comes to mind, just like you would
when interpreting Fate Questions.
But if you really are stuck on an interpretation then
let it go and move on for the sake of narrative flow.

## Your adventure will thank you for it.

THE “I DUNNO” RULE

# RANDOM EVENTS

Dyson cautiously peers around the corner in
the corridor. The fluorescents are out, but the dim
red emergency lights have kicked on, and he can
see the stairwell door at the end of the hall.
Dyson’s Player asks the Fate Question, “Is there
anything in the hall?” Mythic says No but triggers
a Random Event.

## The Context doesn’t suggest any particular

Event Focus, so the Player rolls on the Event

### Focus Table and gets NPC Negative. Rolling on

the Characters List, they get “Giant spiders.”
It looks like something bad is going to happen
to a giant spider. That sounds like an action to the

### Player, so they roll on the Actions Meaning Tables

and get “Betray” and “Weapon”.
The Player thinks about this a moment and
decides that “Betray” means the spiders are
fighting amongst themselves. Weapons could refer
to the spiders as well since they were part of a
secret weaponizing project.

## The player runs with this interpretation: as

Dyson peers around the corner, he sees that the
hall is clear but there is motion in a room along
the hall. It’s a big conference room with a large
plate glass window facing the hall. Inside the
room are a group of giant spiders.
While Dyson watches one giant spider
approaches another spider and suddenly pounces
on it. They begin thrashing about in a violent
battle. Several more spiders join the fray and now
it’s an arachnid brawl!
“Let’s make a run for the door while they’re
distracted with each other!” Dyson says, perhaps
too brave for his own good.
With his shield raised, he and Dr.

## Copenhagen make a mad dash for the door.

Dyson hopes that giant spiders are only a Level
10 problem, but of course Level 9 is sure to have
its own horrifying obstacles.
The Player plays out the Scene with Dyson
having to defend against a spider that spilled out
into the hall.  Despite this, his plan is successful
and they make their way through the door and up
to Level 9. This level, they discover, has become
overrun with mutated plants. Vines crisscross the
walls and ceiling, some of them writhing.
Later in the Scene Dyson and Sandra find
themselves trapped in a laboratory with a former
scientist who’s turned into some sort of moss
person. He seems to have lost his mind and Sandra
suggests that if he touches them they may become
infected with the same creeping moss condition.

## No one wants to turn into creeping moss.

Dyson looks for a way out of this room, ideally
one that won’t require pushing past the shambling
moss-man. His Player asks the Fate Question, “Is
there a way out of here?” Mythic says Yes but also
gives them a Random Event.
Up to this point the Player hasn’t determined
what the moss-man is doing, just that he’s in the
room with them and appears to be contagious.

## They decide to use Current Context as the Event


### Focus instead of rolling on the Event Focus Table.

While Random Events are unexpected events
that inject themselves into your Scene, like the
spider brawl in the previous Random Event,
they can also be used to help explain something
your Character is already dealing with.
In this example, the Player is using the
Random Event to determine what the moss-
man is doing. His behavior is the Random
Event. The Player likely would have had to
determine the NPC’s behavior eventually
anyway, maybe with a Fate Question, but
the appearance of the Random Event seemed
like a good opportunity to do so now.
Since this Event is about an NPC, the Player
rolls on the Characters Elements Meaning

### Table and gets “Frantic” and “Ambush”. An

interpretation immediately springs to mind.
The moss-man, aware of their presence, begins
to franticly wave his arms in a slow, shambling
way, seemingly trying to attack. For a slow-
moving, slow-witted moss-man, this might be his
best attempt at an ambush.
5454 5555


---

# RANDOM EVENTS

Interpreting the Meaning words of “Frantic” and “Ambush” to mean
the moss-man attacks in its own slow motion frantic way is a bit of
a stretch as an interpretation, but that’s fine. It’s what came to the
Player’s mind and it still fits close enough with the results generated.
“Don’t let him touch you!” Dr. Copenhagen cries as Dyson rushes
the creature and slams him with his shield to knock him back. He just
needs to clear enough room for them to get to the door at the other end
of the room without being turned into walking plants.
They succeed in battering their way past the moss-man and close the
door behind them.
Level 8 is perhaps the strangest level so far, with one of the oddest
mutations. This floor has been taken over by sentient water coolers
that stab people with their water dispenser faucets—which are now
fanged—to suck their blood.
Dyson has witnessed enough of the coolers’ dastardly deeds to know
he doesn’t want to become their next drink. He and Dr. Copenhagen
manage to cobble together a makeshift explosive they hope to use to
clear the cafeteria where a group of vampiric coolers have gathered to
hang out and gossip about humans.
Dyson needs to plant the bomb close enough to hit the coolers, so he
sneaks into the cafeteria. As he crawls across the floor, the Player asks a

## Fate Question that triggers a Random Event.


### Rolling on the Event Focus Table, they get PC Negative. Uh oh. The


### Player rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables to see what’s happening and

gets “Fight” and “Outside”. An interpretation comes easily.

### Dyson’s about halfway to the table he wants to stick the bomb under

when a commotion erupts in one of the adjoining halls. Dyson hears
yelling and gunfire.
The coolers in the cafeteria go berserk, angrily sliding around as
they prepare to attack whoever’s out there, probably other survivors also
trying to get to the stairwell.

### This is bad timing for Dyson, who’s crouched under a table in the

middle of a cafeteria full of agitated, blood-sucking water coolers.
Of the three Random Events in this example this one was the easiest
for the Player to interpret. A Focus of PC Negative and Meaning

## Words of “Fight” and “Outside” immediately suggested an idea to the

Player that fit exactly with Mythic’s prompts. Sometimes that’s how it
is, the Random Event prompts fit so neatly with the current moment
that there’s hardly any interpretation required.

Scenes
F
ate Questions and Random Events cover almost
anything you could think to ask about in an
adventure and anything unexpected that might
be thrown your way. But before you can get to
playing, there’s one more thing we need to go over:
structure. Without a framework to connect one part
of the narrative to the next, all those Questions and

## Events aren’t much more than a jumble of details.


## In a typical social role-playing scenario, the

Game Master maintains this structure implicitly,
but solo play requires something more concrete.
Mythic uses a simple Scene structure that’s
mostly there to help you keep track of where your
adventure is going so you’re less likely to get lost
in the weeds.


---

# MAKING A


---

# BIG SCENE

Scenes are a unit of time we use to identify what’s
going on and who is involved. Think of it like a
movie or show: something happens in the Scene,
and certain Characters are part of the action. When
the main action of the Scene is resolved, the Scene is
over, and the story moves on to the next Scene.
The same is true in traditional social role-
playing. Your Characters enter a room and deal with
what’s inside; they have a surprise encounter in a
forest; they visit a town to procure new equipment.
Something specific happens with certain Characters
in a finite amount of time, and then you move on.
You’re forming Scenes; you just aren’t stating it.
Mythic adventures work the same, but the Scene
structure is explicit instead of implicit. This makes
it easier to keep track of everything as you go.

## Elements Of A Scene


## Here are the elements common to all Mythic

Scenes that shape our adventures:
 » LISTS: A collection of adventure goals to
pursue and Characters to interact with.
 » SCENE STRUCTURE:  The way you
determine the beginning and end of a
Scene. Besides the First Scene, there are
three kinds of Scenes: Expected, Altered,
and Interrupt.
 » PLAYING:  The content of a Scene -
everything that happens and what your
Player Characters do in response. This is
where the adventure takes place.
 » BOOKKEEPING:  Updating Lists and
the Chaos Factor, usually at the end of a
Scene. If you’re recording your adventure
in some way this is also a good time to
update that record.
This chapter gives you everything you need to
run exciting and effective Mythic adventures,
but there’s more to discover. Once you’ve gotten
the hang of the basics, you can head to the
“Variations” chapter for additional rules on the
mechanics we’ve covered elsewhere in this book,
as well as strategies for dealing with issues you
may encounter along the way.
THERE’S MORE!

# PREPARING LISTS

Before you begin an adventure you need to
get your Adventure Lists ready. You can find the
Adventure Lists sheet in the “Random Events”
chapter and at the back of this book.
Often you’ll start with a fresh, empty set
of Lists, but you can populate your Lists with
any elements you’d like to begin the adventure
with. There are many reasons you might do
this. Maybe you already have some ideas, like
interesting Characters to encounter or a starting
goal to pursue. Or maybe this adventure is part
of an ongoing campaign, and you want to add

## Characters and Threads from previous adventures.

Adding elements to your Lists before you begin
is a good way to seed your adventure with ideas.
Mythic will take these ideas and weave them into
the narrative as you play, guiding you toward the
experience you want.
The Player is beginning a fantasy adventure
of court intrigue in which the PC is the royal
magician. They’ve been thinking about this
adventure for some time so they’re coming to the
table with a few ideas.
They have a couple NPCs in mind, so they
add them to the Characters List: King Renfry,
the royal family, and the castle staff. These
Characters will develop organically through the
adventure. The Player also has a goal in mind for
the PC—“Survive court politics”—which they
add to the Threads List. This gets the ball rolling
for the themes and tropes they want to explore.
That’s everything the Player’s come up with for
the adventure going in. Now it’s up to Mythic to
help them shape it all into something interesting.

# THREADS &

# CHARACTERS LISTS

There are two Lists that will help you
keep track of the important elements in your
adventure: the Threads List for the PC’s goals
and the Characters List for the various NPCs that


---

# ELEMENTS OF A SCENE

# SCENES

populate the adventure
world. These Lists
are important for the
development of your
adventure—they’re
what Mythic uses to
bring the important
adventure elements into
play whenever you roll on
the Event Focus Table.

## If you get the Event

Focus of NPC Action
for a Random Event,
for example, then
you would roll on
the Characters

## List to see which

NPC was acting,
while getting the result of
Move Toward A Thread
would call for a roll on
the Threads List to see
which Thread you’d be
making progress on.
Threads List
Threads are the quests, tasks, and missions you
choose to pursue through your Player Character.
You can make anything into an open Thread at
any time by writing it on the Threads List. Once
a Thread has been added to the List it becomes an
important part of your adventure and will likely be
invoked by Random Events.
The Player’s pulp-era sailor, marooned on an
island of dinosaurs and strange prehistoric
creatures, starts out with the Threads “Find a way
off the island” and “Locate missing crewmembers.”
Later in the adventure, after learning about a
magic stone that heals wounds, the Player adds the

## Thread “Find the mystical stone.”

Characters List
The Characters List is where
you record important Non-Player
Characters and other active adventure
elements as the PC encounters them.

## It’s up to you to decide whether a

Character is important enough to
make the List, but a good rule
of thumb is to add anything or
anyone that can influence the
adventure.
The PC starts the adventure
with the first mate of his
stranded ship, “Tocky
McAdams”, on the
Characters List. Later,
when the PC runs afoul of a
particularly bad-tempered bird
of prey, the Player decides to add
“Bertha the Angry Avian” to the
List so she’s more likely to make
another appearance.


---

# NON-CHARACTER ELEMENTS

In Mythic terms, a Character is anything
your PC can interact with in some way, shape, or
form. This category isn’t exclusive to people and
creatures—anything can be a Character as long as
it has some activity of its own.


---

# LOCATIONS

Adding locations to your Characters List is a
good way to draw out interesting encounters linked
to those places.
The island the PC’s stranded on is thick with
jungle plants and wild animals, and there are
many natural dangers from quicksand to sudden
cliffs. The Player decides to make the jungle itself
a Character by adding “Jungle” to the Characters
List. A Random Event invoking the jungle as an
NPC could involve a danger or boon from the
6060 6161


---

# SCENES

jungle itself, such as being attacked by a wild
animal or discovering a source of drinkable water.


---

# GROUPS

Including a group as a Character is a good
way to represent a common type of NPC in your
adventure. In our pulp adventure, the Player
might put “Dinosaurs” on the Characters List as
a catchall for any dinosaur the PC comes across.
In a medieval fantasy adventure, the Player might
add “Townspeople” to represent any random
character the PC might meet in town.
As Random Events create encounters with a
group, Mythic may generate individual NPCs
you can also add to your Characters List. This
is a great way to introduce a general class of
Characters to your adventure that becomes more
detailed with specific NPCs as you play.


---

# OBJECTS

Much like locations, objects that can act on
their own make good Characters. A starship
prone to mechanical problems might go on
your Characters List to represent adventure
opportunities when the ship has a sudden and
unexpected system failure.


---

# WHEN TO ADD


---

# SOMETHING TO THE LIST


## Adding non-character elements to the

Characters List is a judgement call on your
part. My advice is to consider whether adding
the non-character element will enhance your
adventure. If you expect trouble in Rattlesnake
Gulch during your western adventure, or if you
want an increased chance of surprises while
you’re in town, then you may want to add it
as a Character. If, on the other hand, you only
expect this location to serve as the place your
PC meets with the sheriff, you may decide not
to give it the added emphasis of being on the
Characters List.
Likewise, it’s your choice whether to add
traditional NPCs to the List when they show up
in your adventure. The sheriff might be important
because he’s your contact for finding bounties to
hunt down, or he might just be there to kickstart
a Thread. The bartender at the local saloon might
be important because she’s a good source of local
gossip, or she might just be there to give your PC
a drink.
In the end, deciding what should be an active
element in your adventure comes down to
expectations and your own desires.
Adding events to the Characters list (especially
before your adventure begins) is a great way
to seed your adventure with desired situations
without knowing exactly when or how Mythic
will add them in. This helps you make sure you
have the kind of adventure you want while still
maintaining a level of surprise.
For example, an adventure set in a zombie
apocalypse might include “A horde appears”
or “A zombie attacks!” as elements on the
Characters List. This increases the chances of
encountering wandering zombie hordes and
experiencing random zombie attacks in your
adventure, which is exactly what you want in a
zombie apocalypse!
Just like with other Characters, treat an event
as something that can act on its own. An Event
Focus of NPC Action that invokes “A zombie
attacks!” from your Characters List means this

## Random Event is about a zombie attacking. If the


## Event Focus invoking “A zombie attacks!” is NPC

Negative, then maybe the attacking zombie is at a
disadvantage, such as being trapped in a car and
unable to reach the PC once they move away. As
with any other Random Event, the Meaning Tables
will give you more specific details.

# ADDING EVENTS TO THE LIST

# SCENES

Updating Lists
Lists are updated during the Bookkeeping
phase at the end of a Scene with anything you
didn’t add during play. This is when you decide
which Characters in the Scene were important
enough to add to the Characters List and whether
anything stands out as a goal you want to add to
the Threads List.


---

# SCENE STRUCTURE

Time in Mythic adventures is conceptualized
as cinematic Scenes in which the action of your
adventure occurs. Scenes usually take place at
certain locations, involve certain Characters,
and revolve around certain actions or events.

## When these actions or events are resolved, the

Scene is over.
A Scene could be your warrior PC exploring
a dungeon chamber, or your smuggler PC
meeting with a potential new client, or your
cryptozoologist PC searching for a mysterious
creature in the forest.
The amount of narrative time a Scene
encompasses is up to you—it could be the fifteen
minutes it takes to explore a room or the year it
takes your PC to hone their swordsmanship skills.
No matter what time frame you’re dealing with,
the Scene is about something specific.

## There are four types of Scenes: the First

Scene, Expected Scenes, Altered Scenes, and
Interrupt Scenes.


---

# THE FIRST SCENE

The First Scene of your adventure is a special
one because it gets the story rolling. There are a
few different ways you can come up with a First
Scene depending on how much Context you’re
starting with and how surprised you want to be.


---

# INSPIRED IDEA

Mythic adventures are full of surprises, but you
can always start with a fully formed idea of your
own. You can think of these as “what if” ideas,
such as “What if my cybernetic superhero PC gets
a lead on the shadowy organization that created
him?” Starting with an idea that excites you
makes for a solid beginning that will lead to a
solid adventure.
The Player Character in a sword-and-sorcery
fantasy world is a knight named Weyland.

## Weyland’s Player wants to come up with their own

First Scene. Since this is their first time playing

## Weyland they only have a handful of ideas about

The start of a new adventure leaves you faced
with a pair of stark, blank Lists. These Lists will
gradually fill with Threads and Characters as the
adventure unfolds, but the First Scene presents
you with a unique opportunity to jumpstart the
process and make your Lists a little less lonely.
Maybe you have certain goals you want to
achieve or NPCs you want to encounter, or maybe
you’re importing Threads and Characters from
previous adventures as part of an ongoing series.
Regardless of your reasons, you can start your
adventure with any elements you want already on
your Lists.
Another way to pre-build your Lists is with the
creation of your First Scene. No matter which
strategy you go with—Inspired Idea, Random

### Event, Meaning Tables, or 4Ws—you can use

elements from your opening prompt to seed your

## Lists before you start playing.

If, for example, you were using the Inspired Idea of
your psychic Character journeying into the astral
realm in search of their missing friend, you could
put “Find my friend” as a Thread and “Lost friend”
on the Characters List. Starting your adventure with
these elements on the Lists allows you to make
early-game Random Events even more meaningful.

who he is. They want to use this adventure as a
way to flesh him out as a Character, starting with
his desire to be a hero.

## The Player chooses this for their First Scene:

Weyland has entered a wild part of the kingdom
where monsters are known to wander freely and
terrorize local villages. He travels to one such
village, whose locals are said to cower in their
homes at night for fear of the creature that’s preying
upon them. Weyland intends to root out the
monster and end its reign of terror once and for all.


---

# RANDOM EVENT

If you want to start surprised or don’t have
anything in mind you can generate a Random

## Event to use as inspiration for your First Scene.

Since this is the beginning of your adventure
there’s a good chance that your Threads and
Characters Lists will be empty. Ignore any result
from the Event Focus Table that calls for an
element from an empty List and use Current
Context as the Focus instead, just like you would
during a regular Random Event.
You may not have a lot of Context to draw
from yet, especially if you’re starting from
scratch, but you aren’t completely empty-handed:
you have a PC, a setting, and an idea of what
you’d like to see in this adventure, especially if
you’re using a chosen RPG that’s built around a
specific world or genre. This is more than enough
to form an interpretation for the First Scene.
Mythic will hone your adventure with more
specific goals and ideas as you play, but at this
stage the possibilities are wide open and all you
need are the Context and the Meaning Tables to
get things off to a good start.
Weyland’s Player decides to start the adventure
with a Random Event. They roll for the Event
Focus and get NPC Negative. Since there aren’t
any NPCs on the Characters List they ignore this
roll and treat the Current Context as the Focus.

### Then they roll on the Actions Meaning Tables

and get “Praise” and “Hope”.
The Player interprets the Random Event this
way: Weyland is making camp after a long day
of trekking through the forest when he hears
someone approaching. He rises to his feet, his
sword drawn.
A haggard man stumbles out from the trees, and
his desperate eyes lock on to the rabbit roasting
over the fire. He beseeches Weyland for food,
saying he’s been lost in the woods and starving for
many days. This becomes the basis for the First
Scene of the adventure.

# MEANING TABLES

You can skip the Event Focus altogether and
go straight to the Meaning Tables for inspiration,
rolling up as many word pairs as you need to
string together an opening narrative.
Weyland’s Player decides to fish for a different
idea by skipping the Random Event and simply
rolling word pairs on the Meaning Tables. On
the Actions Meaning Tables, they get “Observe”
and “Benefits”. They move to the Locations

### Elements Meaning Table for a starting location

and get “Enclosed” and “Extravagant”.

## This is how the Player interprets these results:

Weyland has been tasked by his king to spy on a
neighboring nation that appears to be prepping for
war. His job is to pose as a soldier in their military
long enough to assess the strength of their forces.
He successfully falls in line with a column of
recruits marching towards a garrison. Once
inside, he finds the outpost to be much more
lavish and well-guarded than a standard border
keep. Something is going on here and Weyland
aims to figure out what.
THE 4W

### A more structured way to use Meaning Tables

for the first Scene is to apply a 4W approach:
Who, What, Where, and Why. You can roll
for these in whatever order you find the most
logical; you can even add How or When if a
randomized method or time period would add
something meaningful to your adventure.
WHO: To find out Who is primarily
involved in the Scene roll on the Characters

### Elements Meaning Table and go with whatever

interpretation makes sense, whether that’s your
own PC, an existing NPC, or a new NPC
inspired by the word pair.

### W HAT: Roll on the Actions Meaning tables to

see What the main activity of the Scene will be.
FIRST SCENE 4W STRATEGY
6464 6565


---

# SCENES

WHERE:  For the location Where the main
activity is taking place roll on the Locations

### Elements Meaning Table. Just like with Who, this

can be any new or existing location that fits the
word pair.

### WHY: Roll on the Actions Meaning Tables to

learn the motivations behind Why the Characters
are taking these actions.
Once you have your 4Ws combine them into the
most interesting interpretation you can think of.

## The PC is a modern mage living in Los Angeles.

The Player has no idea what the adventure will be
about and they want to be surprised.
Starting with Who, the Player rolls on the

### Characters Elements Meaning Table to get

“Excited” and “Unusual”. Interesting. The Player
decides to wait until they have more information to
attempt an interpretation.
Next is What. Rolling on the Actions Meaning

### Tables gives the Player “Fail” and “Portal”. Hmm,

a failed portal … Again the Player decides to hold
off on interpreting for now.

## For Where the Player rolls on the Locations


### Elements Meaning Table and gets “Lively” and

“Festive”. This sounds like a party or festival.
Finally, the Player rolls for Why on the Actions

### Tables and gets “Travel” and “Project”.

So, they have a Who of “Excited” and
“Unusual”, a What of “Fail” and “Portal”, a
Where of “Lively” and “Festive”, and a Why of
“Travel” and “Project”.
The Player thinks about this for a moment then
they decide on this interpretation: The PC has
been invited to a special Day of the Dead Festival.
The partygoers themselves are dead—or rather,
undead. They are a community of beings who
have been summoned by spellcasters over the years.

### Unable to return to the afterlife, they now live

quietly in Los Angeles searching for a way to get
back to where they belong.
When the Player Character gets to the party he
sees an assortment of undead in varying stages of
decay socializing with each other. The festival is
spirited (though the PC dares not eat any of the
food served), but the undead revelers have a goal
beyond merrymaking: they hope to open a portal to
the Underworld so they can all return to rest. The
festival is one part celebration of unlife and one
part conference as they invite local mages to help
them solve their dilemma.
The Player is happy with this interpretation and
decides to add these ideas to their Lists before
beginning the adventure. To the Threads List they
add “Help the undead return to the Underworld”;
to the Characters List they add “Community of
undead” and “Other mages at the festival”. The
Player is now ready to begin their adventure with
a nicely detailed First Scene.

# SCENES

# EXPECTED SCENES


## Mythic adventures move fluidly from one

Scene to the next, with each new Scene adding
details to the growing narrative. New plot twists
develop, new Threads are discovered, and new
NPCs emerge, while existing Characters take
new actions. Every choice you make affects the
outcome of future Scenes as you strive to achieve
your goals, fulfill open Threads, and reach a
satisfying conclusion.
When a Scene comes to an end the first thing
you do before beginning the next one is decide
how you think it’ll start, usually based on what
you want your PC to do next. This is called an
Expected Scene.
The First Scene of the Player’s adventure saw
their detective Character visited in his office
by a mysterious new client begging him to
investigate the murder of her late husband. The
police ruled his death a suicide, but she thinks
otherwise. Through her, the PC learned that
the victim owed a great deal of money to an old
army buddy who threatened his life if he didn’t
pay it back—a promising lead with which to
start the investigation.
With the opening Scene concluded the Player
must now decide how they think the next Scene
will begin. They decide the Expected Scene is
about their PC dropping in on the suspect at his
place of work to question him.
Most of the time the Expected Scene will be
based on what you decide your Character plans
to do. Our detective Character wants to follow
up on a lead so that forms the basis of the Player’s
Expected Scene.
Whatever your Expected Scene is you won’t
know for sure whether or not it will happen that
way until you test it.

## Testing The Expected Scene

Before we dive into the new Scene we have
to check if your expectations happen using the
Chaos Factor. Roll a d10 and compare it to
the current CF value. If you roll above the CF
then the Expected Scene starts exactly how you
thought it would; if you roll equal to or less than
the CF then your Expected Scene changes in
some way.
In cases when your Expected Scene is changed
check the number you rolled. If the number is
odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) then it becomes an Altered
Scene; if the number is even (2, 4, 6, or 8) then it
becomes an Interrupt Scene.


---

# ALTERED SCENES


## If your Expected Scene becomes an Altered

Scene then the Scene begins in the next most
expected way, as though Mythic heard your idea
and said, “Let’s try something else instead.” The

## Altered Scene may be nearly identical to the

Expected Scene except for one detail, or it may
be quite different, but it must make sense for it to
happen instead of the Expected Scene.

# SCENES

The Player’s Expected Scene of the detective
dropping in on a suspect at work is changed to
an Altered Scene. They decide that the next most
expected Scene would be the PC discovering that
the suspect isn’t at work and dropping by his
home instead.

## Below are some ideas for coming up with

Altered Scenes.

## The Next Expectation

This is the default method, as explained above:
Mythic said No to the Scene you expected, so go
with whatever Scene you’d most expect besides
that one.
A Tweak
Altering a Scene can be as simple as making a
single tweak to your Expected Scene.
In a fantasy adventure, the local forest spirits are
lashing out at the forest’s inhabitants. The Player
Character is trying to figure out what angered
the spirits when a wild fire breaks out. The next
Expected Scene is the PC venturing into the fire
zone to find what caused it, but when the Player
tests that Expected Scene an Altered Scene is
triggered instead.
The Player decides to stick to the Expected Scene
with one small tweak: instead of needing to
investigate, the PC immediately finds the fire
spirit that started the blaze. Now the Player can
begin the Scene by playing out the encounter.

## Think about all the different elements of an

Expected Scene: the activity taking place, the
NPCs involved, the objects of importance, and
the location it all happens in. A change to any of
these elements would give you an Altered Scene.
Since our Expected Scene with the forest fire
had no NPCs in it, adding a Character, the fire
spirit, was an easy tweak. The activity in this
Scene is the fire itself, so tweaking that could


---

# SCENES

mean that the fire is bigger or smaller than
expected. There were no important objects in our
Expected Scene so a tweak there could be adding
one, like a magical stone provided by an ally to
protect the PC from the fire.
Fate Question
If you’re not quite sure how to Alter the Scene,
or you have several ideas with no clear winner, you
can always ask a Fate Question to help you choose.

## In an occult horror adventure set in ancient

Rome, the Player’s Roman soldier Character is
investigating reports of cattle going missing in the
countryside. The PC, along with a handful of
fellow soldiers, has spent several Scenes marching
deeper into the hills, encountering signs of rituals
and black magic.
The current Scene ends when the PC returns to
camp one night and finds his compatriots missing.
The Player decides that the Expected Scene is this:
“I arm myself and go into the woods in search of
the soldiers.”

## A roll against the Chaos Factor turns this into an

Altered Scene. The Player has a couple of ideas
for Alterations: finding footprints of the soldiers
leading into the woods; finding a dead soldier
(which would make sense with how the adventure
has been going lately); finding a soldier who’s still
alive. All three ideas seem equally plausible so the
Player isn’t sure which one it should be. They’re
leaning slightly toward finding footprints as the
alteration so they test this with a Fate Question:
“Is the Altered Scene finding footprints?”
With a Yes the Player would go with finding
footprints of the soldiers as the Altered Scene.
 A No might mean it’s not footprints that are
found. With that option off the table the next
most likely idea for an alteration is finding a
dead soldier.
An Exceptional Yes might mean taking Yes one
step further and finding not just footprints but a
live soldier.
An Exceptional No might mean taking No one
step further and finding multiple dead soldiers.

### Meaning Tables Inspiration


### Just as the Meaning Tables offer inspiration

for Random Events they can also offer inspiration
for an Altered Scene. Choose whichever Meaning

### Table seems the most appropriate given the

Context—Actions, Descriptions, or Elements —
and then roll for a word pair to help you change
the Expected Scene.

## In the fantasy adventure about angry spirits the

PC discovered in the previous Scene that the forest
fire was caused by a fire spirit. They successfully
calmed the spirit, halting the spread of the fire,
and learned in the process that the spirits are
This section covers a number of strategies for
turning an Expected Scene into an Altered Scene.
The method you choose will depend on how
you like to play and how easy it is to modify the

## Expected Scene you’re working with.

If you’re fine with assuming some narrative control
over your adventure, and the Expected Scene
has an obvious second choice, then The Next

## Expectation or A Tweak is probably the way to go.

If you want more randomness, aren’t sure how
to Alter the Scene, or simply feel uncomfortable
assuming that much control, then a Fate Question,

### Meaning Tables Inspiration, or Scene Adjustment


### Table roll may be more to your liking.

As you role-play using Mythic you’ll likely find
yourself favoring one of these strategies most of
the time and using a second one as backup based
on what best fits your style of play and adds the
most fun to your game.

restless because something has disturbed a sacred
space beneath the earth.
In the next Scene, the PC makes their way to the
mouth of a cave that leads deep underground.
Somewhere down there is the sacred space the
spirit mentioned.
The Player decides that the next Expected Scene
is “My Character enters the cave to search for the
sacred space.” Testing that Expected Scene results
in an Altered Scene.
Unsure of how to alter the Scene, the Player seeks
inspiration from the Actions Meaning Tables for
an additional element to Alter the Scene. They roll
“Distrust” and “Innocent” which they interpret
to mean that the ground shakes intermittently
(their reasoning is that the ground is usually solid
and therefore “innocent”, so now it should be
“distrusted”.) The whole cave seems somewhat
unstable, so cave-ins and other such perils may be
an issue during the exploration ahead.

### Scene Adjustment Table

For a more randomized Tweak, roll a d10
and consult the Scene Adjustment Table to see
what element changes in your Expected Scene.
Options include adding or removing a Character,
changing the intensity of an activity, and adding
or removing an object. Interpret the result in the
Context of your Expected Scene to change it. If
you roll a result that isn’t possible in the current

## Context (such as Remove A Character when the

Expected Scene didn’t mention any Characters),
roll again.

## In the ancient Roman horror adventure, the

Player Character finds one of his comrades in
the woods. The panicked soldier raves about
a creature that attacked him and dragged the
others away.
In the next Scene, the PC and his terrified
companion comb the forest in search of the others.
The Scene ends when they discover an ancient,
crumbling castle nestled in the wilderness.

## The Player comes up with a new Expected

Scene: “We enter the castle, our torches held high
to help us search.” When tested this becomes an
Altered Scene. The Player rolls a d10 on the

### Scene Adjustment Table and gets Remove A

Character, which they interpret like so: “When
we approach the castle the terrified soldier
refuses to venture inside, too scared to go any
further. I must go in alone.”

### Let’s go over each of the table’s possible results.


---

# REMOVE A CHARACTER

Choose the most logical Character to remove
from the Expected Scene.
In the example above, the Player would remove
the frightened soldier since he was the only other
Character in the Expected Scene. If there were
no NPCs in the Expected Scene then the Player
would roll on the Scene Adjustment Table again.


---

# SCENE ADJUSTMENT TABLE

1d10 RESULT
1 Remove A Character
2 Add A Character
3 Reduce/Remove An Activity
4 Increase An Activity

# SCENES

# ADD A CHARACTER


## Choose the most logical NPC on the


## Characters List and add them to the Scene.

Sticking with our Roman horror adventure,
a Scene Adjustment Table result of Add A
Character could mean that the PC and his
companion encounter another missing soldier as
they enter the crumbling castle.

## REDUCE/REMOVE AN ACTIVITY

Reduce the intensity of an active element in
your Expected Scene, or remove it completely if
that makes more sense.
In the earlier example with the restless spirits,
the forest fire was an active element in the

### Expected Scene. A Scene Adjustment Table result

of Reduce/Remove An Activity could indicate
that the fire is of lesser intensity than originally
expected, perhaps just a wisp of smoke signaling
the start of a fire.


---

# INCREASE AN ACTIVITY


## Increase the intensity of an activity in the

Expected Scene.
Sticking with the forest fire, a roll of Increase
An Activity could indicate that the fire is much
bigger than originally envisioned, and the PC will
need to be very careful if they’re going to venture
into it.


---

# REMOVE AN OBJECT


## Remove a significant object in your Expected

Scene, choosing whichever object makes the
most sense.
For the Roman example, maybe the PC and his
companion enter the castle only for their torches
to run out of fuel and gutter out.
7070 7171


---

# SCENES


---

# ADD AN OBJECT


## Add a significant object to your Expected

Scene. If nothing logical comes to mind you can
roll for inspiration on the Meaning Tables.
Perhaps as the Roman Characters enter the
castle the PC sees a sword lying on the ground
that belonged to one of the missing soldiers,
indicating that they were brought this way.

## MAKE 2 ADJUSTMENTS

Make two adjustments to the Expected Scene
instead of one, rolling on the Scene Adjustment

### Table until you have determined both

adjustments. If this result is generated again
simply ignore it and reroll. If you roll two results
that conflict with each other ignore the second
roll and just use the first.


---

# INTERRUPT SCENES

While Altered Scenes play off your
expectations, Interrupt Scenes ignore them
entirely; anything can happen.

## If your Expected Scene becomes an Interrupt

Scene, then Mythic derails your expectations
to send the narrative in a new and unforeseen
direction. You generate an Interrupt Scene the
same way you’d generate a Random Event: roll
for the Event Focus and Event Meaning, then
interpret the results in Context.
The detective PC investigating the death of his
client’s husband is about to visit a suspect at his
workplace—the next Expected Scene. The Player
rolls to test this Expected Scene and gets a 2.
Since 2 is less than the current Chaos Factor of 4
an Interrupt Scene will happen instead.

## To generate a Random Event for the Interrupt


### Scene, the Player rolls on the Event Focus Table

and gets NPC Action. Rolling on the Characters
List invokes Ricky No-Thumb, another suspect
the detective identified in an earlier Scene. Ricky
runs an illegal gambling operation that the
victim often visited.

### The Player rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables

to see what Ricky is doing and gets “Disrupt”
and “Path”. The Player comes up with the
EXPECTED SCENE:  A fantasy warrior PC is
exploring the Dungeon of Fel-Azar, an ancient
undead wizard. After checking a few cobwebby
rooms and battling a giant scorpion, the PC
makes her way down a corridor by torchlight. The
Player expects the next Scene to be checking out
another room to see what’s in it.
ALTERED SCENE: Instead of exploring the next
room the PC has an encounter in the corridor.
INTERRUPT SCENE: The Player rolls PC Negative
on the Event Focus Table and gets “Ambush”
and “Pain” on the Actions Meaning Tables. They
interpret this to mean that their Character springs
a trap as she makes her way down the corridor.
EXPECTED SCENE:  A post-apocalyptic PC sneaks
through an enemy encampment at night to steal
gasoline for his vehicle.
ALTERED SCENE: The PC finds a cache of fuel
right away, but it’s guarded by two soldiers.
Instead of sneaking through the camp the Scene
will be about overcoming the guards without
raising an alarm.

### INTERRUPT SCENE: The Event Focus Table gives


## NPC Negative with the NPC result of “Choose”.

The Player chooses “Enemy warband” since
that’s who the PC is currently robbing. The

### Event Meaning Tables give “Punish” and “Battle”.


## The Player comes up with this interpretation:

Before the PC can attempt his planned theft the
encampment is attacked by a rival road gang,
resulting in all-out battle the PC will have to
survive long enough to swipe the fuel he needs.

following Interruption: The PC heads downstairs
from his office to go and pay Johnny Loanshark
a visit, but there’s someone waiting for him.
Leaning against the PC’s car door is a large and
angry-looking man whom the PC unfortunately
recognizes as Ricky No-Thumb.

## This Interruption stopped the Expected

Scene from happening and created an entirely
new Scene, one that forces the detective into an
encounter with another Character. Considering
Ricky’s hostile demeanor, this Scene will likely
lead to new revelations about the relationships
between the PC’s client, her dead husband, and
the suspects in his case.

## Making Connections

Expected Scenes flow together organically:
they start as you expect them to and follow the
trajectory of the Player Character’s actions. If your
Character chooses to enter a room and search it,
that’s the basis for an Expected Scene. If your
Character then leaves the room and explores the
dungeon further, that’s another Expected Scene.

## Altered Scenes are close enough to your

Expected Scene that they,
too, tend to flow
together organically. Maybe your Character
finishes ransacking a room and leaves to explore
the dungeon further, and you get an Altered

## Scene that you interpret as a monster in the hall.

Interrupt Scenes disturb that flow of events,
so it may not be immediately obvious how it
connects to your previous Scene. Keep in mind
that this Event is interrupting the expected
transition from one Scene to the next. If you take
into account how the previous Scene ended and
what the Player Character is currently trying to
do, you should be able to interpret this new Scene
in a way that fits the current Context.
In the example above, the Player Character was
about to drop in on a suspect when the Interrupt
Scene happened. This Context gives the new

## Scene a logical tie-in to the adventure.

# THE SCENE

Once you have the concept for your Scene
ironed out (whether it’s the first Scene, Expected,
Altered, or Interrupted), it’s time to get into the
Scene and do some role-playing! Now the action
of your adventures can take place, with Fate
Questions there to tell you anything you
need to know as you play.
A sci-fi Player Character who stole a set
of blueprints for an off-world client is
fleeing a cybernetic agent tasked with
retrieving them. The PC should be
able to escape if they can make it to their
ship hidden in the foothills.
Their Player rolls an Interrupted Scene that
begins with the agent spotting the PC on
a busy nighttime street. The PC takes off
running, hoping to lose the agent in the crowd.
The Player asks the Fate Question, “Is the area
busy tonight, with lots of people on the street?”

giving it Odds of Very Likely. Mythic says Yes.
Their Character pushes through the throng with
the agent in hot pursuit. Strangers yell at them
both as they jostle past, and a car honks its horn
as the PC darts across the street.
The Player asks, “Do I see any shops that would
be good to duck into?”  giving it Odds of 50/50.

## Mythic comes back with Exceptional Yes.


## The Player interprets this to mean that their

Character spots the perfect place: a fancy multi-
story restaurant with plenty of people inside
to serve as distraction. The plan is for the PC
to dash inside, run upstairs, and escape out a
window to one of the neighboring buildings.
The PC bursts into the restaurant, startling a
waiter into dropping a tray of food. Diners cry
out in alarm as the PC sprints across the dining
room and races up the stairs.
The Player asks, “Is the agent close behind me?”
setting the Odds to Unlikely. Mythic comes back
with No. That’s good news—maybe the agent
got bogged down by the crowd like they hoped.
Now it’s time to make a move and lose him
completely. When the PC reaches the second
floor, the Player asks, “Is there a window I can
go through that leads somewhere?” setting the
Odds to Very Likely. Mythic comes back with
Yes. The PC opens a window and leaps to the
roof of another building.
The action in a Mythic Scene progresses in
this fashion, with Fate Questions helping you plot
your way. Details for the adventure are built Scene
by Scene. The further into an adventure you get,
the more detail your narrative has, until the story
takes on a life of its own.
Twists & Turns
Your expectations set the standard for what
happens next in your adventure. Sometimes
these expectations are tested with Fate Questions
or Expected Scenes, and sometimes they’re
completely subverted by Random Events or
Interrupt Scenes that introduce unforeseen twists
and turns. Mythic’s mechanics for introducing
the unexpected can change the narrative of your
adventure in ways you never would have guessed.
The Player is using Mythic with their favorite
fantasy RPG to play a solo adventure. Bering
the Magnificent, their fantasy warlock PC, is
attempting to cast a powerful spell that will
summon and bind a demon. The wild magic
required for the summoning means there’s a good
chance of failure or mishap.
Mythic’s framework (using Fate Questions to
gather information and a Scenes structure
to contain the action) is all about building the
narrative details of your adventure. Fate Questions
are the kinds of things you’d ask a live Game

## Master if you were playing with one.

If you’re using Mythic with another role-playing
game, then Mythic will act as the Game Master by
answering your questions while you use the rules
of your chosen RPG to handle the situations they
cover, such as combat and skill resolution.
When the Player in the earlier sci-fi example asked
a Fate Question to see if the pursuing agent was
close behind, they could have replaced it with a
task resolution roll against the agility skill of the
RPG they were using. If they succeeded on the
agility roll, then the PC would outrun the agent.
There’s a lot of overlap between what you can
frame as a Fate Question and what can be
resolved with your chosen RPG. How you choose
to handle these uncertainties is up to you, but
Mythic gives you the tools to ask Fate Questions
at any time. You can even use them to replace
certain rules in your RPG, as covered in the “Fate
Questions” chapter.

# MYTHIC WITH ANOTHER RPG

# SCENES

After an unfortunate toss of the dice, the Player
determines that Bering’s casting attempt fails,
badly. The RPG rules state that for a casting
failure this bad, the Game Master should come
up with a suitable mishap. Since this is a GM-
less solo adventure, the Player asks the Fate
Question, “Does something unexpected happen as
a result of the failed spell?” with Odds of Nearly
Certain. Mythic comes back with Yes and a
Random Event.
The Player decides that the Yes means there’s
an explosion that leaves Bering a little burned,
since that seems like the most logical expectation
for the failure of a spell like this. Since they
also got a Random Event, the Player decides to
make it a part of the failed spell mishap. The

### Event Focus Table gives them “Introduce New


### NPC”, and the Meaning Tables give the words

“Recruit” and “Outside”.
The Player interprets this to mean that although
the spell failed to summon a demon, it did
summon someone from the future. This is an
unexpected twist in the adventure. Not only
does the rest of the Scene play out in a way the
Player didn’t expect, but the whole course of the
adventure changes direction as Bering figures out
what to do with this stranger from a distant era.

## Beginning And Ending Scenes

Just as the time frame of a Scene is up to you,
so too are its beginning and ending. A Scene may
start when your Character physically enters an area
and end when they leave, but that’s only one way
of doing it. Time can just as easily mark the start
and end of Scenes. If you have a Scene in which
your Character checks out a cave to make sure
it’s safe before camping there for the night, then
your next Scene might begin in the same location
the next morning. Let yourself be guided by your
interests and the main action of the Scene. Your
adventure should be a string of interesting Scenes,
with each one leading to the next.
When a Scene ends, and you’re ready for the
next one, come up with an Expected Scene for what
you think that Scene will be about. If your PC is
a superhero who just thwarted a robot rampage
downtown, then the Expected Scene might be your
Character meeting up with their scientist friend to
figure out where the robot came from.
Coming up with an Expected Scene is a
starting point for that Scene. Mythic will tell
you whether the Scene starts as you expect or is
changed into an Altered or Interrupt Scene.
Below are some ways to determine when to
start and end a Scene.


---

# INTEREST


## The default approach to starting and ending


## Scenes is to focus on points of interest: start a

Scene when something interesting happens and
end it when the interesting event is over.
The Player is playing a sci-fi investigation game
set in the big city. Their PC is a cybernetically
enhanced police officer on the hunt for an
android who’s been killing corporate executives.
The Player just finished a Scene in which the PC
searched the site of the latest corporate killing and
picked up a few clues, including evidence that the
android is getting tech from the black market.

## What should be the next Expected Scene?

The Adventure Journal sheet (found on the next
page and in the back of the book) gives you a
place to title your adventure, record the current
Chaos Factor, summarize Scenes in the order they
happen, and write down any other important
notes. This sheet, along with the Adventure Lists
(also found at the back), is all you need to keep
track of your ever-expanding solo adventure.

# SCENES

The Player considers what’s catching their
interest. The PC could look up an underworld
contact to question them for leads, or stake out
a black-market dealer in hopes of spotting the
fugitive android, or meet with a colleague in the
police department who might be able to point
him in the right direction. All of these are valid
Expected Scenes that are based on what is most
interesting to the Player and what action they
want their Character to take.
The Player settles on the PC visiting an
underworld contact to question them. Now,
what’s the most interesting way to start the
Scene? The Player decides that the PC meets his
contact at their “office”, a café that serves as a
front for illicit activities. The Scene consists of
the PC sitting at a table to chat with them about
illegal weapons deals.
After a few Fate Questions, the PC starts to get
nervous. His contact is being evasive, and there’s
an unusual amount of muscle in the room. Is this
a setup?
The tension snaps when the contact signals for
the bodyguards to gang up on the PC and kill
him. In the ensuing brawl, the PC manages to
hold them off long enough to leap out a window
and escape.
The Player could decide to continue this Scene
by having the PC search for a safe place to hide,
but the original point of interest was the meeting.
After the fight and the escape, this point of
interest has ended—a good sign that the Scene
should come to a close.


---

# TIME OR LOCATION

A jump in time or change in location is
another way to mark the transition from one
Scene to the next.

## The PC is a survivor in a post-apocalyptic world.


## She spent a Scene exploring a wrecked airplane

and decided to make camp there for the night. If
the Player wanted a time-based transition, then
the Scene could end with her bunking down, and
the new Scene could start when she wakes up a
few hours later; if the Player wanted a location-
based transition, then the Scene could end when
the PC completes her exploration of the wreck
and moves on.


---

# NARRATIVE SHIFT

Instead of viewing Scenes as discrete units of
activity or interest, another way to view them is as
a continuous stream whose transitions are marked
by narrative shifts. Let’s revisit our earlier example.
The cybernetic cop is investigating a crime scene
when he finds evidence of illegal weaponry.
That’s a shift in the narrative, a dramatic new
piece of information that changes the Context of
the adventure.
The Player ends the Scene there and decides
that the next Expected Scene should be the PC
visiting his underworld contact at the café. The
meeting goes smoothly at first, but then it turns
violent. This time, instead of playing out the
fight like they did in the previous example, the
Player stops the Scene here because it represents a
shift in the narrative. The next Expected Scene
is how the Player thinks this situation is going to
go down. The PC is still at the café, still meeting
with the contact, and is just about to get into
a fight. The time, place, and situation haven’t
changed, but the narrative focus has.
By placing the emphasis on narrative shifts, you
get a greater degree of control over how those shifts
play out.
The Player’s Expected Scene is that two of the
bodyguards pull guns on the PC and rush at
him while his contact slips away. Details like
this would normally be determined with Fate
7878


---

# SCENES

Questions (e.g., “Do a couple of guards come at
me with guns?”), but the Player is using them as
an Expected Scene instead.
The Scene then plays out along the established
narrative lines—a big brawl in this case. When
the PC leaps through a window and escapes, the
narrative shifts again, and it’s time for a new
Expected Scene.
MOOD
Similar to basing Scenes on narrative shifts,
you can also base Scenes on mood shifts, ending
a Scene when you feel that the mood of the
adventure has changed. This doesn’t have to
involve interest, time, place, or story changes—it’s
entirely based on how you feel.
The Player’s fantasy barbarian is exploring a
dungeon. She goes from room to room, killing
monsters, claiming loot, and surviving traps.
If the Player were taking an interest-based
approach, they might make each room its own
Scene, building up curiosity for every search. A
time- or location-based approach would be much
the same, with Scenes changing as the PC moves
from one portion of the dungeon to the next.
Using narrative shifts, the PC might spend the
same Scene exploring rooms and hallways until
something new happens, like encountering a
monster or springing a trap, and then start a new
Scene to play out this event.
With a mood-based approach, the Player might
do any of the above or none of them. Maybe
busting into rooms and battling beasts and
springing traps all fit their current mood, so the
Player keeps going until it gets old and they want
something different to happen. Their mood is
shifting, so it’s time for a new Scene.


---

# AUTOMATIC INTERRUPT

Your adventure is moving along nicely until
you hit a dead end in the narrative. You have
no idea where to go from here or what the next
Expected Scene should be. Now what?
This dilemma happens in traditional, guided
role-playing, too. Maybe the Players missed some
cues earlier in the adventure, or maybe they didn’t
choose the route the GM expected them to take,
Solo play styles can broadly be broken down
into two categories: simulationist and theatrical.
A simulationist Player wants their adventure to
emulate a virtual reality, with events proceeding
in a logical fashion regardless of whether they
serve a larger plot. A theatrical Player, on the
other hand, is more interested in treating the
adventure like an ongoing story, with all the
narrative structure one would expect.
Both styles of play have differing expectations. A
simulationist player tends to prioritize surprises,
while a theatrical player tends to prioritize
drama and tension. Each of the suggested
strategies for starting and ending Scenes fits
one style or either.

derailing an important part of the adventure.
However it happened, The Players find themselves
at a loss for what to do next. This is the point
where a savvy Game Master will make something
happen to get the PCs back on track.

## You can simulate this intervention with

Mythic by choosing to make the next Scene an
automatic Interrupt Scene. Skip the roll against
the Chaos Factor and go straight into generating
a Random Event. This will create something new
to interact with and should be enough to get you
back in the groove.
If you want to take it a step further, you can
also skip the Event Focus Table and make the

## Focus an automatic Move Toward A Thread.

This guarantees that the Scene will bring your PC
closer to resolving an open goal, thus moving the
adventure forward.
The Player’s barbarian has explored much of the
dungeon, overcoming traps and battling restless
undead. At this point the Player isn’t sure what
should happen next. They’ve generated room
after room, using Fate Questions and Meaning

### Tables to determine encounters, but now they

think something should happen to give the
dungeon crawl more flavor.

## The Player has a few different goals on their

Threads list, including to find the dungeon’s
fabled treasure. They could make something
happen with an Expected Scene, like “The PC
finds a clue about the treasure”, but that feels too
much like railroading, and they want to keep
some level of surprise.
They decide to let Mythic choose what happens
next by making the next Scene an automatic
Interrupt Scene. This way they don’t have to
come up with an Expected Scene or roll against
the Chaos Factor.
Since they want this Interrupt Scene to progress
the adventure, the Player also chooses to make
the Event Focus an automatic Move Toward A
Thread. Whatever the next Scene is about, the
Player knows it will be something unexpected
that pushes the PC toward one of their goals.

## The Many Questions Pitfall

With Fate Questions always ready to give you
information, it’s tempting to fish for more specific
answers. While you can ask as many Questions as
Here is a summary of the five strategies for
starting and ending Scenes.
 » INTEREST: Scenes are based on a goal or
activity. (The default method.)
 » TIME OR LOCATION: Scenes are triggered by
a change in time or location.
 » NARRATIVE SHIFT: Scenes end when
something important happens that shifts the
focus of the adventure.
 » MOOD: Scenes end when you feel like it’s time
to energize the adventure with a new Scene.
 » AUTOMATIC INTERRUPT: The new Scene is
automatically an Interrupt. (Best for when you
feel stuck on what should happen next.)
You can use any one of these strategies in your
adventure, or you can switch them up as needed.
Maybe you normally base Scenes on interest,
but the current Scene isn’t going anywhere
interesting, so you use a shift in location to mark
the end of the Scene instead. A few Scenes later,
things start to feel stale, so you end the current
Scene based on mood and start a new one. When
the adventure heats up later on with a lot going
on at once, you use a narrative shift to break
things off into a new Scene so the fast-paced
action stays relatively organized.
Each method has its own distinct feel, and there’s
no right answer for which to use when. Do
whatever works best for you.

you like, asking too many can easily slow down
your game.
Edward, a pirate Player Character, finally
locates the Cove of Sorrows that houses the
treasure hoard he’s been searching for.
The Player asks the Fate Question, “Is the
treasure just as the stories foretold?” Mythic
comes back with a Yes.
The Player wants more information, so they ask,
“Is it mostly gold?” Mythic says No.
“Is it mostly jewels?” Mythic says Exceptional Yes.
The Player interprets this to mean there is some
gold here and there, but the jewels are piled high.
In the example above, the Player asked three
Questions to get a sense of what the treasure
hoard looked like, but they could have stopped
after the first one, “Is the treasure just as the
stories foretold?” There is so much expectation
and Context behind that Question. The Player
could have run with it, improvising a description
of the treasure based on what they expected, since
Mythic confirmed that the treasure is “just as the
stories foretold”.
A good rule of thumb is to try and limit
yourself to one single Question for a given
situation. If that doesn’t give you enough to go
on, ask a second one. Most of the time your
expectations will take over from there.
Keep in mind that there are four possible
answers to any Fate Question: Yes, No,
Exceptional Yes, and Exceptional No. This gives
you a nice range of potential outcomes with just
one Question.
In the pirate example above, the Question, “Is
the treasure just as the stories foretold?” has four
possible answers, each drawing from expectations
based on the Context of the adventure so far. The
interpreted answers could be something like this:
YES: It’s just as the stories say. There are heaps
of gold and jewels pouring from overstuffed
chests, fine art and antiquities stolen from long
lost ships, and weapons from warlords forgotten
to time.
NO: The stories exaggerated. There are a few
chests stuffed with gold and jewels, but the hoard
isn’t as epic as you hoped.
EXCEPTIONAL YES: The hoard is beyond
what the stories say, with more gold and jewels
than you could fit on your ship. The cavern is
stuffed with it, the ceiling shimmering with the
reflections of a nation’s worth of wealth.
EXCEPTIONAL NO: There’s nothing but
empty chests and a few gold pieces scattered on
the ground—someone beat you to the plunder.
In this example one Question leads to four very
different results, and each result is packed with
a wealth of detail just from expectations; there’s
hardly any need to ask for more information.
Asking as few Fate Questions as possible keeps
the game moving swiftly, since most of the details
in your adventure can be derived from your
expectations. When you’re no longer certain
about what happens that’s when you ask another
Fate Question. Mythic adventures flow from Fate
Question to Fate Question, with your expectations
filling the gaps in between.
Whether you’re playing solo or using Mythic to
guide a group adventure, the goal is to have fun
and enjoy the experience. To that end it’s helpful
when interpreting Mythic’s answers to trust
your gut and listen to your instincts. Tapping
into your imagination will turn Mythic prompts
into opportunities for you to run with your
expectations, leading to wonderful improvisation
as new ideas are unleashed.

## Tension Building Questions

The excitement of any good story lies in
the tension, and a role-playing adventure is no
different. The best way to build tension in a
solo or GM-less adventure is by asking conflict-
oriented Questions. Such Questions may be
difficult to ask—the answer might put your
Character in peril or lead your adventure into
a whole new direction—but embracing those
difficult Questions makes for a more exciting
experience. Some of the best moments in a
Mythic adventure will happen when you ask a
hard Question whose answer you’re genuinely
worried about. How will Mythic respond?
What will happen to the PC? These are exciting
moments, the kind of moments you’ll remember
long after the adventure is over. You reach these
tension-laden junctions by asking hard Questions
when the time is right.
Bering The Magnificent’s adventure has taken
an odd twist with the arrival of the NPC from
the future. The Traveler is a warrior who says
that in twenty years a legendary dragon will be
unleashed that will destroy the world. Bering
decides to help the stranger avert this dark future
by ensuring the dragon remains trapped inside its
volcanic prison.
The key to their quest is a mystical amulet with
the power to unlock the gateway into the volcano,
a passage that was sealed by the gods an age ago.
A doomsday cult is also seeking the amulet, with
the goal of freeing the dragon and unleashing
its chaos upon the world. The Traveler wants to
find the amulet before they do and destroy it.
Their eventful journey includes the search for
a lost map that reveals the amulet’s location,
exploring ancient catacombs to uncover clues,
run-ins with cult members, and a king who
wants the amulet for himself to control the
dragon for his own ambitions. Bering and the
Traveler agree to team up with the king’s spy,
and they all work together to survive the dangers
of a trap-infested dungeon while cultists hunt
them down.
After helping each other through many deadly
perils, they finally reach the central chamber
where the amulet is located. No sooner do they
enter the room than the stone slab door begins
to slide shut, and molten lava seeps in from
vents near the ceiling. The spy uses a piece of
timber to block the door from sealing them
inside, narrowing averting their fiery fate.
8282


---

# SCENES

Just when they think they’re safe, undead
skeletons crawl up from crypts in the chamber.
While Bering and the Traveler fight them off,
the spy takes the opportunity to seize the amulet
from the central altar.
The Scene culminates in Bering and his
companion defeating the undead just as the spy
makes his way to the door, amulet in hand. The
spy could easily betray them in this moment. All
he’d have to do is kick the timber out of the way
and let the door close on his companions. Then
he could bring the artifact to his king and receive
a handsome reward.
Up to this point the spy has been a trustworthy
ally. They’ve all worked together against their
common enemy, the cultists. But the Player
knows that the spy has his own mission to
accomplish. The question now is, will the spy
choose his king over his companions?
Narratively, it would be easier to assume that the
spy will wait for Bering and the Traveler—after
all, he’s been helpful so far. But after an honest
look at the Context, the Player has to admit that
the spy’s motivations have always been suspect.
This alliance is one of convenience, and if there
were ever a moment he’d throw the others under
the bus this would be it.
“Does the spy betray Bering?” is a difficult
Question to ask because it fundamentally changes
the story. If the answer is Yes, then Bering has
lost both the amulet and a valuable ally and
is now stuck in a death trap. Bering can likely
use his magic to escape the room, but from then
on he’d have to consider the spy and his king
as much of an enemy as the cult, which would
make his quest even more of a challenge.

## You can imagine how genuinely nervous the

Player feels as they roll the dice to learn the
outcome. It’s a Question filled with tension—
which is exactly what we want.
Hard Questions build tension in your adventure,
but narrative-killing Questions block it. How can
you tell the difference?

## You may be nervous to ask a tension-building

Question because it might steer your adventure
into very different territory, but this kind of
tension is exciting because it involves the
unknown. Narrative-killing Questions, however,
stop the story in its tracks. The plot doesn’t
continue into the unknown—it just ends. All
storylines conclude at some point but ending one
too soon robs you of the chance to reach a more
satisfying resolution.
One way to tell whether your Question builds
on the narrative or kills it is whether you’re
interested in the outcome. Does the answer to
the Question interest you, or are you only asking
it because you feel like you have to?
For instance, when Bering and his companions
entered the room, the Player asked the Fate
Question “Does the door slide shut?” That’s a
good, tension building Question, and it makes
sense to ask given how many traps they’ve
encountered in the dungeon. The Player expects
this room to be trapped, too, and the possibility
of the door closing seems logical and interesting.
Alternatively, the Player could have asked, “Does
the door slide shut, crushing the spy to death?”
That Question could kill off the spy just like that
and end an entire storyline with no real payoff.
Between those two Questions, the Player
probably finds the first more interesting than the
second, not to mention more plausible from an
expectations point of view.
Focusing on tension-building Questions that draw
your interest will keep you from asking Questions
that send your adventure off a cliff.

# MEANING


### Mythic’s Meaning Tables aren’t just good for

adding important Context to Random Events,
they can also be used to add detail to your
adventure world without asking a Fate Question.

### You can roll on a Meaning Table any time you

want to know something a Yes/No Fate Question
doesn’t easily cover: determining Character
backgrounds, learning what a new NPC looks like,
discovering what action is happening in a Scene …
any detail you like. This is especially useful when
you don’t have any concrete expectations.

### The Core Meaning Tables

The “Random Events” chapter introduces
the core Meaning Tables: Actions, Descriptions,
Locations Elements, Characters Elements, and

### Objects Elements. These five tables should cover

just about anything that might come up in your
adventure.
In our earlier example, pirate captain Edward
discovered a cavern full of wondrous treasure. As
he digs through the find with his crew he comes
across a closed chest.
The Player wants to know what’s inside the
chest. They could go with their expectations
and say it’s the same as everything else in the
hoard—gold, jewels, and art—but they want to
add more detail to this treasure haul Scene, and
getting specific about the contents of the chest is a
good way to do it.

## Since the Player wants to be surprised

Discovering Meaning seems like a better option
than coming up with a Fate Question. Out of
the five core Meaning Tables they narrow it
down to two options: Descriptions and Objects.

### In this Context the Descriptions Tables could

describe the general contents of the chest, while
the Objects Table could focus on a specific,
noteworthy item in the chest.
After thinking it over the Player decides to go
with the Objects Table to represent the one thing
in the chest that stands out the most.

## Rolling twice on the Object Elements Meaning


### Table gets them “Natural” and “Moving” —

definitely not what the Player expected! They
come up with this interpretation: Edward opens
the chest, eager to see what new delight is inside,
and falls back in surprise when dozens of live
crabs spill out. The chest is full of them! He
quickly stands and brushes himself off, reminding
himself that the treasure’s been here for a very
long time—apparently long enough to collect
crustaceous stowaways.
When you trust yourself and listen to your
instincts, Mythic’s prompts can be a magic carpet
ride to unlimited possibilities. But if you view the
prompt too literally, they can hold you back instead
of propelling you forward.
For example, let’s say your spacefaring Character
picks up a distress beacon from a nearby planet
on their ship’s scanners, so they decide to
land on the planet and explore it in search of
the beacon’s source. As you’re playing out the

## Scene you get a Random Event with a Focus of


## NPC Action that invokes a mercenary Character.


### Rolling on the Meaning Tables gives you “Disrupt”

and “Location”.
Taken literally these words may be hard to
interpret. But if you move beyond their literal
meaning, a distress beacon could be seen as
a marker for a location. Maybe the mercenary
tells you the beacon isn’t really from a stranded
ship, but from pirates trying to lure people in to
raid them! In this interpretation, the mercenary
“disrupts” what you thought the “location” was by
informing you it’s actually something else.

## Getting More Specific


## The “Random Events” chapter offers five core


### Elements Meaning Tables, but there are even

more than that. You’ll find 45 Elements Tables on
the following pages, each themed to something
specific. There are tables for describing dungeons,
forests, spell effects, and more. There’s also a whole
suite of Character-oriented tables for determining
what an NPC looks like, what they’re doing, their
motivations, their background, etc.

### These specialized Elements Tables offer you

another degree of granularity for when you want
it. There’s no wrong choice when picking which
table to use. The main Actions and Descriptions

### Tables are general enough that they can be

applied to anything; the core Elements Tables get
a little more specific when it comes to Locations,
Characters, and Objects; and the extra Elements

### Tables take it a step further by getting even more

specific about certain subjects.
After loading up his ship with loot, Edward
explores the Cove of Sorrows and encounters
a new NPC. The Player wants to generate a
description for this Character using Meaning

### Tables. They could use the most general tables,


### Descriptions Meaning Tables; or they could get

more specific and use the Characters Elements

### Meaning Table; or they could get even more

specific and use the Character Descriptors

### Elements Meaning Table. Any of these tables

would give good, useful results to the Player—all
they have to do is pick one and run with it.

## Some Additional Thoughts


### Most of the Elements Meaning Tables are self-

explanatory—for instance, the Creature Descriptors
table can be used for describing creatures, and the

### Animal Actions Table for defining what an animal

does. To help you choose which ones to use, below
are descriptions of the various tables.

### With so many Elements Meaning Tables to

choose from you may find yourself unable to
pick or wanting to roll on more than one. I say
do it! The purpose of the Meaning Tables is in
the name: they’re meant to add meaning to your
adventure. There’s no reason why you can’t roll
on as many tables as you want, as many times as
you want, until you have enough input to make a
solid interpretation.
Say you encounter a new NPC while exploring
a burnt-out building in a post-apocalypse
adventure. A Fate Question tells you this is a
hostile encounter; now you need to determine
who they are and what they’re doing.

## You could roll on any or all of the following


### Elements Tables: Character Appearance to

get an idea of what they look like, Character
Descriptors to add more detail to that
description, Character Identity to determine
what kind of NPC they are, Character Actions,
Combat to see what hostile action they take,
and Character Conversations when your
Character tries to talk with them to find out why
they’re attacking.
If you chose to roll on all of them you might get
something like this: (Dirty/Official) The attacker
is wearing a weathered Northern Army uniform.
(Colorful/Strange) His skin is a bright purple color;
presumably he’s been mutated by the Quantum
Bombs that destroyed the city. (Leader/Law) You
can tell by the insignia on his uniform that he
is a high-ranking administrator in the Northern
Army—a non-combat position. (Ambush/
Frightening) He was hiding behind a pile of rubble
until you entered the building, when he wildly
opened fire on you. (Assist/Mistrust) As you
duck behind cover you ask why he’s shooting at a
fellow Northern soldier; he says he doesn’t trust
the army anymore and that everyone is out for
themselves now.
GET ROLLING!

### The three default Elements Meaning Tables—

Locations, Characters, and Objects—are repeated
on the following pages to keep the Elements

### Meaning Tables all in one place for easy reference.


## You can also find a collection of all the Meaning


### Tables, including Actions and Descriptions,

# ADVENTURE TONE

& PLOT TWISTS
If you’re constructing an adventure in advance
and want some help from Mythic you can use the

### Adventure Tone Elements Table to guide you.

You’re constructing a fantasy adventure and
want to determine the overall tone. A few rolls
on the Adventure Tone Elements Table give us
“Bizarre” and “Reassuring”. You may interpret
this to mean that this is a high-magic adventure
world with lots of fantastical creatures and
spell-craft as a part of everyday life. Despite these
extraordinary elements, the adventure world is
a stable one for your Character who fits right in
with all the strangeness.

### The Plot Twists Elements Table can be used

to modify your results from the Adventure Tone

### Table or as your Meaning Table for a Random

Event that you think will change the course of
your narrative.

# ALIEN SPECIES DESCRIPTORS

This is meant for sci-fi adventures that feature
aliens on distant worlds. The table is biased
toward intelligent species, the kind found in a
functioning civilization.

# ANIMAL ACTIONS


### This table focuses on actions a wild animal

might take. This is useful for describing the
behavior of animals or any other creature that’s
feral, out of its mind, or extremely confused.

# ARMY DESCRIPTORS


### This table will give you the characteristics of

an army. It’s applicable to any large military force,
independent of genre.


---

# LOCATION DESCRIPTORS


## The following is a list of all the Elements


### Tables for describing locations:

 » THE CAVERN TABLE is good for
natural, enclosed spaces such as cave systems.
 » THE CITY TABLE is for settlements of
any size, from tiny villages to sprawling
cities.
 » THE DOMICILE TABLE describes the
details of a living space, such as the outside
of a house or the inside of a bedroom.

of atmospheric descriptions one would
expect from a classic dungeon crawl.
 » THE FOREST TABLE is good for thick
jungles or woods full of forbidding trees.
 » THE LOCATIONS TABLE  is the most
generic of the bunch, useful for defining
any location.
 » THE STARSHIP TABLE can be used
for any sci-fi structure, from the inside
of a spaceship to the hallways of an
underground moon base.
 » THE TERRAIN TABLE describes the
topographical details of an area of land or an
entire world viewed from orbit.

# CHARACTERS


### Tables describing Characters are the most

numerous category of Elements Meaning Tables,
making up 12 of the total 45. You can use these
tables to build entire Characters from the ground
up—including your own Player Character!—or
to generate important details about NPCs as you
encounter them.
 » THE CHARACTERS TABLE  is the most
generic of the Characters Elements Tables,
meant to cover anything Character-related.
 » THE CHARACTER ACTIONS,

## COMBAT TABLE  suggests actions an

NPC might take in a battle.
 » THE CHARACTER ACTIONS,
GENERAL TABLE  covers any kind of
action an NPC might take.
 » THE CHARACTER APPEARANCE

 » THE CHARACTER
CONVERSATIONS TABLE  is useful
when figuring out what a Character is
saying.

 » THE CHARACTER SKILLS TABLE
tells you what talents a Character has.
 » THE CHARACTER TRAITS &

## FLAWS TABLE  is similar to Character

Personality but focuses more on things that
help or hinder the Character.

### Using several of these tables together can help

you quickly flesh out an NPC.
The Player Character in an espionage adventure
needs to meet with a new NPC, Nate Calhoun,
to acquire a fake passport and identity papers. In
this Scene the PC is introduced to Calhoun late
at night on a street in San Francisco.
The Player knows nothing about Calhoun
other than that he is a known source of fake
identification, servicing both government spies
and the criminal underworld. They want to start
off the encounter with a physical description of
Calhoun, so they roll on the Character Appearance

### Elements Table, getting “Frail” and “Aromatic”.

The Player interprets this to mean that Calhoun is
a very thin man smoking a cigarette.

## As the PC engages Calhoun in conversation, the


### Player rolls on the Character Personality Table

to get an idea of what kind of person Calhoun
is. They roll “Interesting” and “Perceptive”.
The Player’s interpretation is that Calhoun
listens closely to what the PC says, asking a
few questions along the way and dropping an
interesting statement in the process.
To figure out what interesting thing Calhoun
says, the Player rolls on the Character

### Conversations Table and gets “Classy” and

“Innocent”. The Player’s interpretation is that
Calhoun plays it cool during the conversation,
not wanting to know anything more than he
needs to for both their sakes. “I heard what I
need, but I didn’t hear anything else. Who you’re
working for is your business—just yours.”

## With these rolls on the Character-oriented


### Elements Meaning Tables, the Player quickly

established the look and personality of Nate
Calhoun. These facts build Context around this
NPC, making it easier to figure out what he does
for the rest of the Scene.

# CIVILIZATION DESCRIPTORS

strokes of an entire civilization, such as their average
technology level or predominant social attitudes.
CREATURE DESCRIPTORS,
CREATURE ABILITIES, &


---

# UNDEAD DESCRIPTORS


### These tables are useful for generating strange,

fantastical creatures or monsters and assigning
them powers and abilities. The Creature

### Descriptors Table is designed for any kind of

creature, while The Undead Descriptors Table is
more targeted to zombies and the like.

### While the Elements Meaning Tables are more

specific than the Actions and Descriptions

### Meaning Tables, they’re still vague enough to

allow for a wide range of possibilities. This makes
it simple to apply an Elements Table to situations
it may not seem intended for.

### You could use the Powers Table to describe

the abilities of a superhero or to determine
what a piece of alien technology does. Animal
Actions seems appropriate for a wolf in the wild,
but it could also help you determine what a
malfunctioning robot does. If an NPC is telling you
shocking news that changes the narrative, you
could roll on the Character Conversations Table
or on the Plot Twists Table.

### While the Elements Tables aren’t as broad as the

core Actions and Descriptions Tables, they can
still be applied to more than one thing.

# CRYPTIC MESSAGE


### This table is perfect for when you need a

foreboding message that says something without
saying much at all, with words that focus on
communication, conflict, and obscurity.


---

# CURSES


### This table is meant for magical curses, with

words that focus on misfortunes.


---

# DUNGEON TRAPS

Everyone loves a good dungeon trap. The
words on this table are meant to suggest how a
trap functions once it’s sprung.
GODS

### This table focuses on generating aspects of a god

that might be worshiped by a fantasy culture or
alien race. It’s not meant for the gods themselves
as individuals, but more for what they represent—
their domains, in other words.


---

# LEGENDS


### This table, meant to inspire ancient legends,

lends itself to multiple rolls building layers of
story around the tales of long ago.


---

# MAGICAL ITEM DESCRIPTORS


### This table is meant to suggest what a magical

item looks like and does.

### Word pairs generated from the Meaning Tables

are meant to be thought of together to inspire an
interpretation. But what do you do if the words you
get aren’t inspiring you?
The PC triggers a magical trap while exploring the
ruins of an ancient temple. Their Player determines
through Fate Questions that they stepped on a glyph
inscribed on the floor that triggers a spell. To figure
out what the activated spell does, the Player rolls on
the Spell Effects Elements Table for inspiration, getting
“Strength” and “Environment”. They aren’t sure how to
interpret these two words together in this Context.
When you’re stuck for an interpretation you can
change the relationship between the two words by
inserting a connector word that turns them into a
short phrase. This slight change in meaning may
inspire an interpretation. For instance:
Of: Inserting “of” between Meaning words combines
them by having the first word highlight an aspect of
the second word. In this case it gives us “Strength of
Environment”, suggesting that the environment itself
is strong. The Player could interpret this to mean that
the entrance to the ruined temple is suddenly and
magically sealed up.
-ly: Adding “ly” to the end of the first word turns it
into a crude adverb that modifies the second word.

## Using it here gives us “Strengthly Environment”. The

Player could interpret this to mean that the glyph
isn’t a trap; it’s a boon that makes the PC super
strong while they’re inside the temple.
And: Placing “and” between the words separates
them into two different, unconnected concepts. In
this case we get “Strength and Environment”. The
Player could interpret this to mean the Character gets
stronger and is also teleported to a new environment.
But: Adding “but” is the opposite of “and”: the first
word is diminished by the second word. In this case
we get “Strength but Environment”. The Player might
interpret this to mean that the building suddenly
loses strength and begins to collapse.
Adding a connector between Meaning words is
a useful technique if a good interpretation isn’t
springing to mind. After you’ve tried a few different
options one interpretation will likely stand out.

# MUTATION DESCRIPTORS


### This table is similar to Powers, with some

subtle differences that take into account the
mixed nature of abilities derived from mutations.
There’s more emphasis on the subject’s body, and
some results imply that a mutation is detrimental.
NAMES

### This table requires a bit more explanation than

the others. It’s a collection of sounds and concepts
that, when combined, are suggestive of names.
Most of the entries are meant to be sounded out
rather than used literally.
The Player is coming up with the name of a
fantasy warrior. They roll “Hee” and “R”. After
sounding these out, they might create names such
as Hir, Huir, or Heer.
Concepts such as “Number” or “Emotion” are
meant to evoke a word related to those concepts
that you can slot into the name.
Generating the name for a town, the Player rolls
“In” and “Elements”. They might come up with
names like Innsea, Inice, or Inflam.
Names for people, places, and things can run
a very wide gamut. The Names Table is meant to
narrow down the possible selections and inspire
a certain sound for the generated name, lending
itself to loose interpretation. Rather than rolling
twice you may want to keep rolling until you get a
sound that comes across as a valid name to you.
The Player Character, a starship captain, is
approaching a new planet that their Player
wants a name for. Rolling on the Names

### Elements Table they get “Tal” and “El”. That

doesn’t sound quite right to them yet so the Player
rolls a third time and gets “Action”. This inspires
the name Tallelrun.
After discovering an advanced civilization on
the planet the PC arranges a meeting with their
leader. To generate his name the Player rolls
“Len”, “In”, “Pr”, “Tar”. This inspires the name
Lennin Pertar.

# NOBLE HOUSE

For creating the general characteristics of a
noble or royal household. It can be thought of as
generating the current state of the Noble House,
or its history.

### Bern is ready for another day of searching for supplies, the Player making heavy use of the Scavenging Results Elements Meaning Table. Just another day

# SCENES

# OBJECTS


### There are several other tables for describing

specific kinds of items but the Objects Table is
general enough that it can be applied to anything.
It works best for when you don’t know what an
object is and want prompts to figure it out.


---

# POWERS


### This Elements Meaning Table is meant to

inspire powers of all sorts, from heroic superpowers
to the strange abilities of an alien creature.


---

# SCAVENGING RESULTS

Designed for post-apocalyptic settings, or any
other site of desolation you’re picking through
for goods, this table tells you what type of items
you’ve uncovered and if the act of scavenging has
put you in danger.


---

# SMELLS & SOUNDS


### These two tables are good for generating sensory

information. They can be applied to any situation
where a Character is testing the air or listening.


---

# SPELL EFFECTS


### This table helps you determine what kind of

spell is being cast—useful when facing an enemy
sorcerer or after springing a magical trap with
a spell-like effect. The results are generalized,
intended to give you a rough category of spell.

# NPC BEHAVIOR

The PC has battled his way through the Canyons
of Chron, slaying beast after beast on an alien
world to prove his worth to a powerful warlord.
He returns triumphant to the warband’s
encampment and is summoned to the warlord’s
tent. The warlord, flanked by guards, leans
forward in his chair and says … .

## What does he say? Where do we go from here?

You figure out what an NPC does in your
adventure the same way you figure out anything
else in Mythic: with expectations, Fate Questions,
and Meaning Tables.
In the example above, if the Player
had a clear expectation for
what the warlord would say,
they might go with that. “The
warlord says he’s impressed
with your performance.”
If they have some idea but
106106


---

# SCENES

aren’t sure, they might frame it as a Fate Question
such as, “Does the warlord say he’s impressed?” If
they had no idea what the warlord would say, they
might roll on a Meaning Table for inspiration.
Using expectations for behavior is good for
unimportant NPCs or when you don’t want to
slow down your adventure to randomize NPC
actions. If you have an idea of what the NPC will
do, and their action is important to the adventure,
you could pose the expected action as a Fate
Question. This adds some randomness to the
NPC’s action—you think you know what they’ll
do but they might do something else.
If you have no idea what the NPC will do then
you can roll a completely random action on a

### Meaning Table. The most useful Meaning Tables

for determining NPC actions are:
 » Actions
 » Characters (Elements)
 » Animal Actions (Elements)
 » Character Actions, Combat (Elements)
 » Character Actions, General (Elements)
 » Character Conversations (Elements)

## Expectations As Actions

Most NPC actions will be determined by your
expectations; you’re probably not going to roll
for every single thing an NPC does. If Bering
the Magnificent is walking through a village
market, then his Player will probably assume that
the NPCs around him are going about their own
business. When you have a clear expectation for
an NPC action, and the action isn’t important
to the course of your adventure, then simply
following your expectations will do.
A warrior PC sits down in a tavern, intent on
getting something to eat and questioning the
barkeeper for news about the area.
The barkeeper is a new NPC, but the Player
decides their initial action in this encounter is
obvious: they come over to the PC’s table and say,
“What can I get you?”

## Discovering Meaning As Actions

Maybe the Player has no idea what the NPC
will do or they want to randomize it. Instead of
following their expectations they can use words
from Meaning Tables.
The warrior’s Player changes their mind and
decides to determine the tavern keeper’s action
using Meaning Tables. Rolling on the Characters

### Elements Table gets them “Odd” and “Passive.”

They interpret this to mean that the barkeeper
shambles over to the PC and grunts at them,
apparently his way of asking the PC what they
would like.

## Fate Questions As Actions

If you have an expectation for the NPC’s
behavior that you’d like to test you could ask a
Fate Question. This is a good choice if the NPC’s
actions are important to your adventure or you
just want to randomize the behavior.

## The Player decides to test their expectation with a

Fate Question. They ask, “Does the barkeeper come
to take my order?” assigning Odds of Certain.

## When determining NPC actions with Fate

Questions choose a behavior the NPC is likely to
do. You don’t have to be sure about this choice since
you’re going to test it with a Fate Question anyway.
If you’re in the middle of an encounter where
the NPC has already taken action you could ask,
“Does the NPC keep doing what they’re doing?”
This is especially useful in tense situations where
an NPC’s actions matter every round but you
don’t want to slow down to think about what
they’ll do each time. Instead, you simply check to
see if they continue a previous action.
Bering the Magnificent is facing off against an
assassin on the deck of a ship during a rough
storm. The Player has a good idea of what the
assassin will do, so they ask the Fate Question,
“Does the assassin attack Bering with his sword?”
with Odds of Nearly Certain. Mythic says Yes,
and the battle begins.
In the next round, the Player wants to see if the
assassin continues fighting in this way, so they
ask, “Does the assassin continue with his current
action?” with Odds of Certain.
Phrase the action as a Fate Question and
assign it Odds like you would with any other Fate

### Question. If it’s a behavior you expect it’s probable

that your Odds will at least be Likely if not
stronger. If you’re unsure then consider the Odds
50/50. If you’re really unsure and just taking a
shot in the dark with a random behavior you
might go with lesser Odds such as Unlikely.

## You can resolve these Fate Questions using


## Mythic’s normal rules or you can consult the


### NPC Behavior Table for suggestions on how to

handle NPC actions.


---

# NPC BEHAVIOR TABLE


### The NPC Behavior Table offers suggestions for

how to interpret Fate Questions about NPC actions.
A Yes answer to a behavior Fate Question is easy
to interpret: the NPC either does what you thought
they would do or continues to do what they were
already doing.
A No answer means the NPC does something
other than what you expected. If you have an idea
of what that would be you can use that as the
action; otherwise, choose a Meaning Table to roll
on for inspiration.
An Exceptional Yes means the NPC does what’s
expected with greater intensity.
You can check for NPC actions as often or as
rarely as you like. Maybe you choose to only
determine an NPC’s first action in an encounter
and follow your expectations from there, or
maybe you’re in a tense confrontation with an
important NPC and want to randomly determine
the Character’s actions round-by-round.
If you’re frequently asking Fate Questions or
consulting Meaning Tables to determine NPC
behavior it’s important to keep your adventure
moving smoothly by taking the broadest
interpretations you can. This will help you not get
held up on a difficult Interpretation.

# KEEP IT LOOSE AND FLOWING

108108

# SCENES

The Player asks the Fate Question “Does the
assassin continue with his current action?” Mythic
answers with an Exceptional Yes. The Player’s
interpretation is that the NPC launches himself at
Bering in an aggressive attack without taking any
defensive precautions.
An Exceptional No means the NPC either does
the opposite of what you expected or does the
next most expected action with greater intensity.
If you don’t have any ideas for an expected
behavior roll on a Meaning Table for inspiration
and make the resulting action more intense.

## A few rounds later Mythic answers Exceptional

No to “Does the assassin continue his current
action?” The fight hasn’t been going well for the
assassin, with Bering using magic to fend him
off. The Player decides that the opposite of what
they expected would be for the assassin to break
away from the fight and flee.
If the Fate Question about NPC behavior
generates a Random Event consider the Event
an additional part of the NPC’s actions, with
Current Context as the Event Focus and the
nature of the action determined by rolling on
a Meaning Table. Combine the result with the
original action if it makes sense; otherwise, treat
them as two separate actions, basing the first
action on the result of your Fate Question and the
second action on the result of the Random Event.
When Bering’s Player rolled Exceptional No for
the assassin’s action they also rolled a Random
Event. The Player rolls on the “Character

### Actions, Combat” Elements Table and gets

“Charge” and “Lie”.

## The Player decides it makes sense to combine the

Random Event with the Fate Question’s answer
of Exceptional No; the Event will help clarify the
NPC’s unexpected action. They interpret it this
way: the assassin charges at Bering again with
a wild battle cry. Bering braces himself for the
impact, his mystic barriers up. But just before he
reaches Bering, the assassin veers to the side and
leaps over the ship’s railing. The charge attack
was a bluff to make Bering hunker down and
give the assassin an opportunity to escape.
Conversations
Saying something is an action, too. When
determining what an NPC says in a conversation
it’s helpful to focus on the overall tone and
message the NPC is trying to convey. Like

the dragon where he thinks they should camp for
the night.

## The Player frames the expected action as a Fate

Question: “Does Gregroth suggest camping next
to a pile of boulders?” They don’t really know
what the dragon will say but this response seems
plausible, so they give the Question Odds of
50/50. Mythic returns a Yes.
Later, after they make camp, Nemenor asks
the dragon who should take first watch during
the night. The Player asks, “Does Gregroth say
he will take first watch?” assigning this Odds
of 50/50. Mythic comes back with a No. The
Player interprets this to mean the dragon says the
knight should take first watch since that seems
like the next most expected thing he would say.
 If specific language is required (maybe you’re
playing in a group setting and want to give the
interaction more color, or maybe you’re writing out
your solo session for a blog post or your personal
journal), then the Player can use any words that
make sense with the rolled results.
The Player words the first exchange between
knight and dragon like this: Nemenor glances at
the sky, noting that they have about an hour left
until dark. “We should start looking for shelter
before nightfall.” He turns to the dragon. “Do
you have a preferred way to camp in the woods?”
Gregroth glances around at their surroundings.
“Rocks. I like rocks. Big rocks. Let’s find a nice
pile of boulders to curl up against, get all warm
and cozy.”
Social Skills
If you’re using Mythic with an RPG that has
social skills you can incorporate skill rolls into
your interactions with NPCs. The results of these
skill rolls become part of the Context, helping
you formulate expectations, adjust the Odds
of Fate Questions, and interpret the roll results
(including any Meaning Table rolls) to interpret
NPC behavior.
From combat to conversations you can determine NPC actions
by using a combination of expectations, Fate Questions, and
Discovering Meaning.

# SCENES

For example, maybe your sci-fi spaceship captain
is trying to talk another ship into assisting them
with repairs, and you roll against your Character’s

## Persuasion skill to get them to cooperate.

Let’s say your Character succeeds. In game
terms this means you talk the other ship into
helping you. If you wanted to use Mythic to play
out this interaction in more detail you’d approach
it with the knowledge that the other ship’s captain
will say yes, so whatever results you get from

## Mythic will have to fit into that Context.

On the other hand, maybe the skill roll
indicates that your Character did a good job at
presenting their case, but it doesn’t guarantee a
specific reaction. You may decide that the skill roll
results adjust the Odds of the Fate Question, “Do
they help us with repairs?”, so that while a failed
roll would give 50/50 Odds of a Yes a successful
roll bumps that up to Very Likely.
You can also use skills to help you decide
what an expected behavior would be. Maybe
your Character succeeded exceptionally well
on their Persuasion roll, and the negotiation is
going so smoothly that you think the other ship
might not only help with repairs but also join
your Character’s quest through space. You may
use these rolls as the basis for a behavior Fate
Question like, “Does the ship captain decide to
join us?”

# END OF SCENE

# BOOKKEEPING

It’s your call when to end a Scene (as discussed
in the “Scene Structure” section on page 63),
but usually a Scene ends when the primary action
in that Scene wraps up. Before you move on to
the next Scene you have a few Bookkeeping tasks
to do.

## Add List Elements

The end of a Scene is the time to add Threads
and Characters to your Lists if they were active in
the Scene. Think about the Scene that just played
out and add any Threads or NPCs that seem
important to the adventure.
If any Threads or Characters already on a List
played a part in the Scene add an additional entry
for them as well. This creates weighted Lists that
make important elements more likely to reappear
in your adventure. Once a specific Thread or NPC
has filled three slots on its List don’t add any more
entries of that element, even if it’s important in a
later Scene.
You can consider a Thread or Character
“important” to the Scene if it was invoked by a
Random Event or something meaningful happens
in a Scene that involves the Thread or Character.


---

# THREADS LIST

Threads are goals that your Player Character is
pursuing. You can add any Thread to the List that
you want, even if it hasn’t come up in a Scene.
Early on in the adventure, the Player Character
decides that Bering will take up a quest to return
a stolen relic treasured by a poor, remote village.

## The Player adds “Return relic” as a Thread.

Later, when Bering emerges from the rat-infested
dungeon, the Player decides he needs more
healing magic. There are no potion sellers nearby
The more interactions you have with an NPC
during an adventure the more you’ll come to
understand them. Over time you’ll get a feel for
what a Character would do or say in any situation,
making it easier to determine actions and
conversations as you go.

# GETTING TO KNOW YOU

and no one around who can teach him healing
spells, so the Player adds “Acquire healing magic”
to the Threads List as a goal to pursue.
A few Scenes after deciding to acquire healing
magic, Bering is chatting with a farmer who’s
tending to a field of cows. Bering has been trailing
a group of travelers he suspects of stealing the sacred
artifact, so he asks the farmer if he’s seen anyone
lately. The farmer mentions seeing a local healer
who helped him with his livestock. Intrigued,
Bering asks for more information and realizes that
this mysterious healer may be a wizard.
This is an important potential lead for Bering to
get his hands on healing potions, which reflects
one of the Threads. At the end of the Scene the
Player writes “Acquire healing magic” for a
second time on the Threads List.

# CHARACTERS LIST


## You can add just about anything to the

Characters List, from individual NPCs to
organizations to geographical areas to objects. If it


---

# END OF SCENE BOOKKEEPING

While adding lots of Threads that interest you
can make for an expansive adventure, there are
also good reasons for keeping your Threads List
sparse. The more Threads you have, the more
options are available for Random Events. You may
like having all that potential for plot twists, but if
the plot is centered around a single core Thread,
those extra plotlines may detract from the focus
of your adventure.
Think about the kind of experience you’re looking
for. If you want something laser-focused on
one goal, be more selective about adding new
Threads. If you’re looking for more of a sandbox
approach, add as many Threads as you like, with
the knowledge that you may sometimes take
significant detours from your primary goal.

has some level of activity and can act for or against
your PC you can add it to the Characters List.
Bering the Magnificent has come across several
different monsters and opponents in the dungeon
he’s exploring, including giant mutated rats, robed
cultists lurking in the shadows, and demonic
frogs squatting in stygian pools. The Player has
added each of these antagonists to the Characters
List. Mutant Rats appear three times on the List
because they’ve featured in many Scenes, while

## Cultists appear twice and Demon Frogs only once.


## After a Scene in which Bering survived a trap, the

Player decides that the dungeon itself should be on
the Characters List to represent pitfalls, cave-ins,
and other nasty surprises.

## Remove List Elements

Review your Threads and Characters Lists
and remove any elements you feel are no longer
relevant to your adventure, (accomplished goals,
defeated enemies, etc.). If the irrelevant Thread
or Character appears more than once on the List
cross out all instances of it.
Removing an NPC doesn’t necessarily mean
they’ve died. Characters can exit an adventure for
all kinds of reasons, including that you’ve deemed
them no longer important to your adventure. The
same is true for Threads: you can remove one
Mythic Lists can get messy over time. Threads get
added as you come across new goals, Characters
get added as they’re introduced, Threads and
Characters get additional entries when they
come into play again, Threads get removed when
they’re completed, Characters get removed when
they lose relevance … there’s a lot going on in
those 25 lines!
If you max out a List with no room for new
entries, it’s time to clean up. Get a fresh, empty
Adventure List sheet and copy over the Threads
and Characters you want to keep, with a single
entry for each element. For any Threads or
Characters with three entries on the original List,
give them two entries on the new List. Doing this
resets the Lists, decreasing elements that have
grown while still retaining weighted importance
for the most popular items.
Cleaning up your Lists is a prime opportunity
to edit them in other ways as well. If you think a
Thread or Character should be removed, go ahead
and do it. Maybe a minor Character who appeared
early on in the Adventure no longer seems
relevant, or maybe there’s a Thread you forgot
about that you’re no longer interested in pursuing.

## You can also consolidate less important

Characters into a single group entry to free up
more space. If you’ve met an innkeeper, a farmer,
and a merchant during your adventure, but none
of them have proven to be important, you could
combine them into a single entry called “Villagers”
on the Characters List.
Your new, revised Lists give your adventure room
to continue evolving. If the new List gets full it’ll be
time to tidy up again.


---

# CLEANING UP LISTS

Editing your Lists after the Scene is over means
you don’t have to pause the action, but it’s not a
bad idea to update them as you play if it doesn’t
slow things down too much. Adding or removing
Threads and Characters during a Scene means
those elements will be available sooner for
Random Events; it also makes Bookkeeping easier
since you won’t have to think back on the Scene
to remember which Threads and Characters
stood out.
You’ll most likely do a combination of the two,
making changes to the Lists as you play and going
over them again at the end of a Scene to make
sure you caught everything.

simply because you are no longer interested in
pursuing it.
In the swashbuckling adventure with Edward the
pirate, the Player has a Thread of “Get vengeance
against the dread pirate Victor”. Then Edward
learns that he wasn’t betrayed by Victor at all but
by the governor of Capsalon Island—he’s been
pursuing the wrong villain! The Player removes
the now-irrelevant Thread from the List and
replaces it with “Bring the governor to justice.”

## Adjust The Chaos Factor


## The final Bookkeeping task is adjusting the

Chaos Factor. Think about the Scene that just
happened and decide whether you think the
Player Character(s) were in control of events—in
other words, whether the Scene was a success or a
failure for them. Did they make progress toward
any of their goals? Did they suffer any setbacks or
sidetracks?
Maybe the PC was seriously wounded while
navigating a building full of explosive traps, but
they still made it through. You might decide
that the progress your Character made is more
important than the damage they sustained, so the

## Scene was more in their control than out of it.

On the other hand, maybe the PC was forced to
retreat back to where they came from, in which
case you might decide that the Scene was more
out of their control than within it.
A Scene that was mostly within your PC’s
control gives the CF a -1 modifier, lowering the
Chaos of the adventure, while a Scene that was
mostly out of their control gives the CF a +1
modifier, raising the Chaos. The CF cannot go
below 1 or above 9; any modifiers that would take
it beyond that range are ignored.

## For alternative methods of adjusting the Chaos


## Factor check out the sidebars “Revert Toward The


## Mean” and “Random Chaos” on this page.

The default rule for the Chaos Factor is to
increase it when a Scene wasn’t under Player

## Character control and decrease it when it was.

This gives the CF a snowball effect, where crisis
begets more crisis and calm begets more calm
until something happens to switch things up.
If you prefer, you can flip this concept on its head
by reverting toward the mean so that the CF
goes up when a Scene goes well for the Player

## Characters and down when a Scene goes poorly.

Instead of a snowball effect, you get a release
valve—the more controlled Scenes you have in
a row the more things are likely to blow up on
the Player Characters; the more things blow up
on them, the more likely things are to calm down
again. This kind of adventure will have a slightly
different feel from the norm, with fewer extreme
mood swings as the Chaos Factor gets continually
nudged back toward the middle.


---

# REVERT TOWARD THE MEAN

Another way to handle the Chaos Factor is to
skip the process of evaluating how well the Player
Character(s) did in a Scene and simply let the
dice decide how the Chaos Factor changes. This
gives you one less thing to worry about in the
Bookkeeping phase.
At the end of a Scene roll a d10. If you roll equal
to the current Chaos Factor or less, give it a -1
modifier with a minimum of 1; if you roll more
than the Chaos Factor, give it a +1 modifier with
a maximum of 9. This detaches the Chaos Factor
from the PC’s actions, letting it ebb and flow at
the whim of the dice.
With this method the tone of your adventure will
shift at random intervals based on your Chaos
rolls from Scene to Scene. As with Revert Toward
The Mean, extreme values will be rare, with the CF
more frequently moving back toward the middle.

# CHOSEN ONE

Let’s put Mythic’s Scene structure through its
paces! Unlike the smaller examples in the rest of
the chapter that put everything in italics, this Big
Example will use italics to indicate the role-played
story and normal text to explain mechanics and
interpretations for maximum readability.
In this example, the Player is running a solo
adventure using Mythic with their favorite fantasy
RPG. Their Character is Lennz, a hunter and
wilderness expert who’s already been through
a few adventures, gaining experience along the
way. He was hired by a mountain village to lead
the Chosen One, a child prophesied to have great
powers, to a hilltop monastery. The route to the
monastery is through rugged terrain in an area
Lennz knows well.
The Player came up with the details of
this adventure using the Plot Twists Elements

### Meaning Tables. They interpreted the word pair,

“Public” and “Require”, as a “public” village that
“required” Lennz to do the task he was hired for.
The idea of the task being a protect-and-deliver
mission for a child religious figure was just
something the Player thought would be cool.
The Player decides that the first Scene will
be about Lennz beginning the trek through the
mountains with the Chosen One. Since this is the
first Scene it doesn’t need to be tested against the

## Chaos Factor to see whether it happens or not.

Since they already have an idea for the
adventure, the Player decides to add the
major details to their Lists. They add “Deliver
the Chosen One” to the Threads List and
“Chosen One”, “Villagers”, and “Mountains”
to the Characters List. They decided to include
“Villagers” on the List to account for anyone they
might meet along the way and “Mountains” to
account for any dangers and resources the rugged
terrain may present.
With their Lists prepared, the Player is ready to
begin the first Scene.

## Deliver the Chosen One The Chosen One

Villagers
MountainsBecause the landscape is too rough for riding
animals, Lennz and the boy are traveling on
foot. The first leg of their journey is easy because
there are paths near the village, which gives

## Lennz some time to chat with the Chosen One.


## It turns out the boy has a proper name: Ninfee

Wryrock. He says he wasn’t born in the village
but was found by a farmer and brought there;
he doesn’t know anything about his own heritage
or history. There’s a strange mark on his arm,
which is apparently what identified him as the
Chosen One, though he doesn’t know much
about the prophecy he’s meant to fulfill.
Most of the details in this Scene were generated
by the Player asking Fate Questions. “Can we
use horses?” No. “Is the terrain near the village
rough?” Exceptional No.

## The Player thought it would make sense for

Lennz and the boy to talk during this first part
of the journey. Since the Player had no idea what
the boy might say, they rolled on the Character

### Conversations Elements Meaning Table for

inspiration and got “Careless” and “Mysterious”.
The Player interpreted this to mean that the
boy is very trusting, answering all of Lennz’s
questions, but that the Chosen One seemed to
know little about his own past.

The Player also figured Lennz would ask if
the Chosen One had a proper name. They made
the possibility of a name into a Fate Question
and got Yes. To determine the boy’s name, the

## Player rolled on the Names Elements Meaning


### Table and got “Nn” and “Fi”. Wanting more to

work with, they rolled some more and got “Wr”
and “Nature”. The Player interpreted this as
Ninfee Wryrock.
This first Scene was simple, establishing what
the adventure will be about. The Player decides
to end the Scene after Lennz and Ninfee spend
the day walking and chatting. Since Lennz was
in control during this Scene, the Player gives -1
to the Chaos Factor, lowering it from the starting
value of 5 to 4.

## The Player records the major details on their


## Adventure Journal sheet as part of their end-of-

Scene Bookkeeping. Then they look over their Lists
to see if anything needs to be added or removed.
Prominent elements in this first Scene included
“The Chosen One”, the “Mountains”, and the
Thread of “Deliver the Chosen One”. Since these
elements are already on the Lists, the Player adds
an additional entry for each. No new Characters
or Threads presented themselves in this Scene.
The Player prepares for the next Scene by
coming up with an Expected Scene. They decide it
would make sense for Lennz and Ninfee to make
camp at nightfall and set out again the next day,
this time encountering more treacherous terrain.
The Player tests this Expected Scene against
the Chaos Factor by rolling a d10. They roll 8,
exceeding the current Chaos Factor of 4, so the

## Expected Scene happens as envisioned.

The next morning, Lennz and Ninfee break
camp and set out again. The farther they get
from the village, the rougher the terrain becomes
as well-trod dirt roads give way to unsullied
rocky ground. They climb many steep hillsides,
with Lennz helping Ninfee when he struggles.
Suddenly, Lennz spots a small warband of orcs
on the other side of the valley, and he pulls Ninfee
behind a boulder to hide before they’re spotted.
This is bad. Lennz is going to have to be very
careful from here on out to avoid contact with
the orcs. He has no idea if they’re aware of the
prophecy, but if they are, they may see Ninfee as
a very valuable hostage.
The two of them move cautiously for the rest of
the day, with Lennz keeping an eye out for orcs.
With the way forward getting more difficult,
the Player began this Scene by asking Fate
Questions about the terrain. “Do we run into any
difficult terrain today?” Yes. “Does Ninfee have
difficulty?” Yes.
A little later, a Fate Question generated a

### Random Event. Rolling on the Event Focus Table,

the Player got “Move Away From A Thread”.
Since there’s only one Thread on the List there
was no need to roll for it.

## The Player rolled on the Actions Meaning


### Tables for inspiration and got “Block” and

“Project”. They had an idea of what this could
mean but weren’t sure about it, so they posed
it as a Fate Question: “Do we encounter orcs?”
Yes. The Player interpreted this to mean that
they unexpectedly came across a warband of orcs

making their way through the mountains, posing
a danger that will hamper their progress.
For the rest of the Scene, as Lennz and Ninfee
make their careful way forward, the Player asks
a Fate Questions from time to time to see if they
run into orcs, but nothing else happens. The Player
decides this is a good place to end the Scene.
For end-of-Scene Bookkeeping, the Player
updates the Adventure Journal with a summary
of Scene 2’s events. Then they think about the
Chaos Factor—was Lennz in control because he
spotted the warband and evaded them, or was he
not in control because they had to change their
course to avoid trouble? The Player decides that
the introduction of the orcs and Lennz having to
change travel tactics was more out of control than
in control, so they raise the Chaos Factor by 1
point, bringing it back to 5.
Now to adjust the Lists. The Player adds
“Avoid the orcs” as a Thread and “Orc warband”
as a Character. They also repeat “Deliver the

## Chosen One” on the Threads List and the “The

Chosen One” on the Characters List since those
elements were relevant this Scene. Both of these
elements now appear three times on their Lists, so
The Player won’t add any more entries of them in
future Scenes.

Now for the next Expected Scene. The Player
assumes that Lennz was given some information
about the region and knows of another village
nearby, so their Expected Scene is that the two of
them will head toward this village in search of help.
The Player rolls a d10 to test this Expected Scene
and gets a 3. This is an odd number within the
Chaos Factor range of 5, which means we get an

## Altered Scene instead of the Expected Scene. The

Player figures that the next most Expected thing to
happen would be running into the orc warband.
Starting Scene 3, the Player asks the Fate

## Question “Do we encounter the orcs the next day?”

Mythic says No. The Player interprets this to mean
the encounter happens that night while they’re
making camp.
“Do the orcs surprise attack us?” Yes.
Lennz and Ninfee spend a tense day staying
out of sight and camp down for the night in a
valley to avoid being seen. Lennz decides they
can rest for now and set out for the nearby
village in the morning.
As they prepare to sleep, Lennz hears a twig snap
in the brush. His keen survival senses have him
reaching for his sword just as three orcs rush into
their camp, and he takes them all on in a fast and
furious fight. The orcs are surprised by how capable
he is in combat—this is no hillside farmer.
While Lennz battles two of the orcs, the third
one makes a run at Ninfee. Lennz cries out for
the boy to run, but Ninfee stands his ground.

There’s a sudden burst of light from the boy, an
outflowing of power, and the orc is thrown back
by the force of the blast.
Surprised and afraid, the orcs retreat back into
the night. Lennz looks at Ninfee, shocked by
the sudden display of power. Ninfee looks just
as surprised.
The Player used the skills and combat rules from
their chosen RPG to play out this Scene. Lennz
rolled well enough to notice the approach of the
orcs and be ready when they pounced.
To guide the combat, the Player started by
asking “Do the orcs focus on Lennz?” This
seemed reasonable since Lennz would be the
biggest threat to take down. Mythic said Yes.
This three-on-one combat continued for several
rounds. Using the NPC Behavior Table each
round, the Player asked the Fate Question, “Do
the orcs continue with their current action?” The
answer each round was Yes, meaning the orcs
continued to fight with Lennz.
On the fourth round, however, the answer was
No. The Player’s interpretation was that one of the
orcs broke off from the fight to go after Ninfee.
Lennz yelled at Ninfee to run, and the Player
asked “Does Ninfee run?” The answer was No,
with a Random Event.

### The Player rolled on the Event Focus Table

and got NPC Action. To determine which NPC
would act, the Player rolled two dice for the
Characters List: one for a List section and one
for an entry in that section. Since two sections of
the List have elements in them, the Player rolled
a d4 to see which section to use. They got a 3,
indicating the second section. Rolling a d10 to
see which element to use, the Player got a 2: “The
Chosen One”.

## The Player rolled on the Actions Meaning


### Tables for inspiration on what Ninfee would do

and got “Open” and “Power”. Given the Context
that the Chosen One supposedly has abilities of
some kind, the Player interpreted this to mean
that Ninfee reacted with a display of raw magical
power to defend himself.
After the orc was knocked back, the Player
asked, “Do the orcs flee?” Yes. Finally, the Player
asked, “Does Ninfee seem surprised by what he
did?” Yes.
This seems like a good place to end the Scene;
now it’s time for Bookkeeping. The Player
summarizes Scene 3 in the Adventure Journal and
adjusts the Chaos Factor.

## While they did survive the orc ambush,

Ninfee’s sudden display of power was a random
surprise. The Player is going to count this as a
Scene out of Lennz’s control, raising the Chaos
Factor to 6.

Thread element. They also add another instance
of “Orc warband” to the Characters List.

# SCENES

The Player pauses to think before coming
up with the next Expected Scene idea. A lot
happened in that last Scene: the orcs discovered
them, and Ninfee displayed impressive powers.

## The Player considers what Lennz might do next.

Since the orcs got away, it would be a good
idea to get moving before they come back
with reinforcements. Lennz could invest some
time in helping Ninfee explore his powers, but
considering how surprised the boy was by their
appearance trying to experiment with them right
now probably isn’t the best course of action.
The Player decides that Lennz is going to pack
up camp and get moving right away while it’s still
dark, covering their tracks as best he can to throw
off pursuers.
With this Expected Scene in mind, the Player
rolls a d10 to test it against the current Chaos
Factor value of 6. They roll 4. This is an even
number within the Chaos Factor range, which
means the next Scene is an Interrupt Scene—
something unexpected is about to happen.

## To determine what the Interruption is, the


### Player rolls on the Event Focus Table and gets

“PC Negative”. It looks like things are about to go
from bad to worse for Lennz and Ninfee.

## The Player rolls on the Actions Meaning


### Tables for inspiration on what happens and gets

“Hinder” and “Weather”. They interpret this to
mean that a snowstorm rolls in as the night wears
in. Now Lennz has to contend with freezing
weather while trying to stay ahead of the orcs.
The two of them hurriedly pack up camp and
head out into the night. Lennz is careful to cover
their tracks, but it probably won’t be long before
the warband returns, more prepared than they
were for their first ambush.
Travel is slow in the dark, but Lennz doesn’t dare
light a torch, only using the light of the moon
to see by. Dark clouds begin to gather, and the
temperature drops until it begins to snow. Ninfee is
cold, and both of them are tired, but Lennz urges
him to continue on even as the storm worsens.

## Dawn finds them still trudging through snow.

They need to find shelter from the cold and get
a few hours of rest. Lennz scans the white-clad
hills around them, looking for any sign of a cave.
He spots something, but it’s not a cave—there’s a
column of smoke coming from the next ridge.
When Lennz paused to look for a possible cave
entrance, the Player asked, “Does he spot a cave?”
giving it Odds of Very Unlikely. They rolled an
Exceptional No.
Lennz saw something that was the opposite
of a cave, or a more intense version of the next
expectation. The Player decided it made the most
sense for him to see some sign of life.
The Player wasn’t sure what this sign was,
so they rolled on the Descriptions Meaning

### Tables and got “Slowly” and “Dirty”. Their

interpretation was a column of smoke slowly
drifting into the sky, as if from a campfire.

## The smoke looks like it could be from a campfire.

It might be a local mountain village, or the
orc warband. Lennz decides that either way it
deserves a look. He guides Ninfee toward the
smoke, keeping low and moving cautiously.
When they make it to the top of the ridge, they
look down and see a small mountain village. The
villagers seem rugged, accustomed to the harsh
conditions of their environment. The smoke is
coming from a fire that looks warm and inviting.

Lennz knows that if he can see the smoke, so can

well. The village appears to have fighters among
them—perhaps they will ally with Lennz when
they find out Ninfee is the Chosen One. Lennz
decides to take the risk and approach them.
When Lennz got in position to identify the
source of the fire, the Player asked the Fate
Question, “Is it the orcs?” They gave this Odds of
50/50 because they had no idea what to expect.
Mythic came back with No.
The next most logical expectation was that
it’s a village, so the Player went with that. To get
a clearer picture of the village, the Player asked,
“Do they look capable?” Mythic came back with
Exceptional Yes.
The Player interpreted this to mean that not
only are the villagers well equipped against the cold
and the storm, they also have fighters among them.
As Lennz and Ninfee walk towards the village,
a pair of spear-wielding warriors see them and
approach. They look tough and threatening,
but as soon as they see Ninfee their demeanor
changes. They recognize him immediately and
their wary greeting changes to one of welcome.
To Lennz’s relief, he and Ninfee are brought into
the circle of warmth and given food. There isn’t
much time to relax, however. Lennz tells the
villagers about the orcs. The villagers have been
fending off warband raiders for months, and
they are ready and willing to help Lennz defend
the boy.
The Player resolved the villager reactions with a
few Fate Questions. “Do they recognize Ninfee?”
Yes. “Are they aware of the warband?” Yes.
This seems like a good place to end Scene 4
and do some Bookkeeping. The Player writes
down a summary of this Scene. Since Lennz and
Ninfee caught a lucky break, the Player decides

## Lennz was in control this Scene, so the Chaos

Factor drops from 6 to 5.

## The orcs were a concern in this Scene, so the

Player adds another instance of “Avoid the orcs” to
the Threads List, reaching the maximum of three.
The Player decides that the sudden storm
is enough to count as the environment acting
against them, so they add “Mountains” again
to the Characters List. They also add another
instance of “Villagers”.

Variations
The Mythic system is built to be modular
and highly customizable. Use the rules you
want, ignore the ones you don’t, and adjust the
ones you’ve chosen to get the desired tone for
your adventures.
Up to this point, the systems in this book have
focused on the essentials of how to construct
and run a satisfying solo role-playing experience.
Many of those core rules offer options for how
to use them, such as the way you start and end
Scenes and whether you roll for an Event Focus
or choose one. This chapter presents more
variant rules with which to modify your Mythic
experience as well as advice on how to get more
out of your adventures.
If you’re new to Mythic, this chapter may be
more useful to you after you’ve played through a
few adventures and familiarized yourself with the
core rules.

# GETTING PREPARED

# FOR A SOLO


---

# ADVENTURE

Getting your act together to run a solo role-
playing session can be just as individualized as the
game itself. What resources do you bring to the
table—if you even use a table? Do you role-play
entirely in your head, or do you write down what
happens as you go? If you do write it down, how
do you go about it?
There’s a lot to consider, so let’s get started on
how to get started!
Papers Please
If you prefer to play with physical books and
paper game sheets, keeping things organized will
make your solo gaming sessions more enjoyable.
Consider sorting your sheets into binders, one
for rulesets and one for Character-related items.
Gather all of your materials ahead of time and
lay them out on the surface you’ll be using. Make
sure you have enough room to write things down
when you need to and enough empty space to
shift things around without moving too many
items at once.
For my own games, I make a habit of taking all
the books and resources I’m using and stacking
them together so I can put them on a bookshelf
in between my adventures. When it’s time to play,

### I simply grab the stack, arrange it on the table in

To make it easier to get organized, all forms and
tables have been collected at the end of this
book. You can also find a quick reference for all
of Mythic’s important rules and mechanics in the
“Rules Summary” chapter.

# FORM FITTING

122122 123123

front of me, and get to playing. Then, when I’m
done, I restack them and put them back on the
shelf. Keeping your notes and reference sheets
“stackable” like this in a folder or binder makes
your entire adventure easy to pull out and easy to
put away.
If you’re new to solo role-playing, it may take
several game sessions for you to hit upon your
own ideal setup. While you’re playing, take note
of organizational strategies that seem to help
and points of frustration to resolve for your next
session. Once you’ve found the way you like to
play, you’ll be able to get yourself set up just right.

## Sourcing An Idea

You may be going solo, but you can still get
some help with ideas. You can take inspiration
from books, movies, TV shows, comics, anime
… anything you enjoy. Maybe you use a few
general concepts as the basis of a first Scene, or
maybe you take things further and populate your
Threads and Characters Lists with ideas from the
sourced material, creating adventure goals and

## NPCs before you even start the opening Scene.

Sourcing an idea like this is a good way to quickly
get the ball rolling with something that captures
your interest from the very start.
Linear Vs. Sandbox
I think many of us tend to approach our
adventures in a linear fashion. It’s second
nature at this point—we’re used to consuming
narratives with a start, a middle, and an end, and
traditional group role-playing is often structured
this way as well. However, you may also want to
consider trying a sandbox approach, which works
especially well with solo role-play.
A sandbox adventure can start off much lighter
than a linear adventure. All you need to know are
some basic facts: who your Character is, what kind
of world they live in, and what they’re doing as you
begin the adventure. Then your first Scene can
simply be plopping your Character into the setting
and seeing what happens. These kinds of adventures
can start off slow but quickly build momentum.
For instance, let’s say you have a Player
Character who flies a starship and ferries goods
from planet to planet with her tight-knit crew, and
you know the setting well: a discrete portion of
the galaxy with trade routes, governments, and a
few warring factions. You might start with a basic
Thread like “Complete the current shipment”
and a Characters List made up of your crew and
the ports you most commonly dock at. The First
Scene might be your PC making sure the ship is
secure and that there are no threats in the vicinity.

## Now all you have to do is begin playing.

The web is chock full of resources for use with
solo role-playing. There are numerous online
guides with lists of resources, so I’ll just touch on
a few here that are most relevant to Mythic play
to get you started.

The advantage of a sandbox approach is that
you can start with little to no story ideas, knowing
that sooner or later, Mythic will throw things your
way that crank up the action in your adventure.

## Recording Your Adventure

This section summarizes the various different
approaches to recording your adventure as you play.


---

# JOURNAL

An easy way to record your adventure is to
keep a notebook and write it out journal style.
This can be as simple as writing “Scene 1” at the
top of the page, recording a summary of what
happened, and moving on to the next Scene. You
can also use your journal to keep track of game
details like the Chaos Factor.
Some people like to journal out more details
until it’s practically a story, while others record
just enough information to remind them later of
what happened.
Not only does a journal allow you to go back
and re-read your adventure, it also helps if you’re
short on time and have to break your adventure
into many smaller sessions—for example, maybe
you can only squeeze in a few Scenes before bed
and then you won’t get to play again for a few
more days. When you finally get back to playing,
a quick glance at the journal will remind you
what happened in your adventure and where you
left off.
BLOG
Go public with your adventures and make
a blog of it! There are tons of Players out there
sharing their recorded adventures. In addition to
being fascinating reading, it’s also a window into
how others play solo, which can offer new and
insightful perspectives.
A blog gives you a simple and elegant way to
record your adventures while exposing them to
an audience who will appreciate them. This is
a way to bring the social element back into solo
play, and on a psychological level, presenting your
adventures to the public can make your adventure
feel more “real”, which is a source of satisfaction
in and of itself.
Not all of us record our adventures in written
or digital form: some of us play out everything
in our heads. We may jot down a few notes, like
Scene summaries and adventure highlights, but
we’re recording the bulk of the adventure in our
memories as we play.
There can be some psychological resistance to
playing a Theater of the Mind style of adventure.
Maybe you feel as though if it isn’t recorded in
some material fashion, then it didn’t happen.
Or maybe it just seems strange to sit there
by yourself, silently rolling dice and consulting
charts, while all the action takes place between
your ears.
If you think about it, though, a Theater of the
Mind solo role-playing experience isn’t all that
different from other forms of entertainment. The
active elements of fiction take place entirely in
our minds: we sit passively while watching movies
and TV shows, silently absorbing what we see
and hear, and we are the only witnesses when
we play single player video games. Reading is a
solo experience, with nothing but a book and our
imagination, and yet it can make our emotions
take flight. These experiences come from external
physical sources, but the enjoyment of them is all
in our heads.
Theater of the Mind solo role-playing is no
different: there’s the external, physical input of
the dice and game mechanics we’re using and the
internal experience of us enjoying it. Additionally,
solo role-playing is an active experience that
requires our constant input and involvement,
making that Theater in your mind a rich and
interesting place.

# VARIATIONS

# NOVELIZATION

This approach is not for the faint of heart, but
it can be very satisfying. When you novelize your
adventure, you write out everything that happens
in detail as you play, like writing a book.
You can make this work by going back and
forth between mechanical game elements and
writing. Ask and answer a series of Fate Questions
about a combat your Player Character is involved
in, then turn to your computer and write it all out
in detail, taking a good deal of creative license.
When you’ve run out of material to write about,
go back to the adventure and resolve the next
step. This back-and-forth process chronicles the
adventure paragraph by paragraph and chapter by
chapter until it’s been fully written out and you’ve
essentially written a novel.
Novelizing your adventure records the action
in great detail, but it is also very, very slow. This
style of recording works well for those who really
enjoy writing and aren’t in a hurry to move your
adventure along.
One satisfying benefit of novelizing your
adventure is the ability to come back to it later—
even months or years later—and re-read the
adventure, transporting yourself back to the frame
of mind you were in when you played it out.


---

# NOTE & EDIT METHOD

If you want a more complete written account
but find writing while playing intrusive to the flow
of gameplay, you can try a note and edit approach.
Focus on your adventure as you play, recording
simple summary notes as you go. Then, after your
adventure session, revisit the notes and take the
time to write them out as a cohesive narrative.
This approach gives you the speed of theater
of the mind with the detail of journaling. How
much detail you write is up to you—whether you
take ten minutes to flesh out the summaries or
an hour to turn them into a story, separating this
process from gameplay lets you focus on role-
playing in the moment.

## Piecemeal Playing

Solo role-playing gives us a lot of freedom,
not only in the stories we experience but also in
the time we allot to playing them. If you can’t
grab a three-hour block of time to play out a full
solo adventure, consider breaking it up. As a solo
Player, you only have yourself to please, so there’s
no one who’s going to complain if you stop the
adventure because you have to run an errand or
pick up the kids. I know people who play a few
Scenes on their train ride to or from work, using
their phone or tablet to roll dice and record what
happens. You don’t need a lot of materials to play
Mythic, nor do you need a lot of time.
Breaking your adventure up into small bites also
has the benefit of giving you time to think about
it. When I break up an adventure, I often have as
much fun thinking about it in the time between
sessions as I do when I’m actually playing. I make
plans for what my Player Character will do and
cook up the basis for the next Expected Scene.

# DETERMINING


---

# NPC STATISTICS

Your Player Character is almost certainly going
to encounter NPCs during their adventure, and
if you’re using Mythic with another role-playing
game, you’re going to need to know the statistics
for those NPCs. You may need to know their
armor value when you attack them, how much
damage they do when they strike, how many hit
points they have, and so on.
You can resolve the statistics of the NPCs as
you encounter them through Fate Questions.

## Expected Statistic Value

When determining a value for an NPC
statistic, first decide what you most expect the
value to be. For instance, you might expect a
small water elemental encountered in a dungeon
to have a slam attack that does 1d6 damage.
Go with the expectation that seems most
reasonable to you, taking the Context of your
adventure into account. If you had determined
that the water elemental was huge, towering
over your Player Character, a more reasonable
assumption of damage might be 2d6 or 1d10.
The power level of your Player Character
and the Context of the adventure should also
be factored in. Maybe your epic-level barbarian
wouldn’t even notice a 1d6 hit, and you’ve been
encountering monsters in this adventure that
regularly deliver damage in the 10+ range, so your
expectation for this creature is 1d10 damage.
Ask Mythic

### After you’ve decided on a reasonable value for

the statistic, turn it into a Fate Question to see if
it’s true. “Does the NPC have this statistical value?”
Determine what you think the Odds are of the
answer being Yes, then resolve the Fate Question.
Since the value you’re questioning is one you
came up with yourself as an expectation, your
Odds will probably be strong, such as Very Likely.
If you aren’t too sure about your expectation,
however, that uncertainty can be reflected in the
Odds. Maybe you have no idea how many hit
points an NPC has or what its armor value is, and
your expectation is just a wild guess. In that case,
you might assign Odds of 50/50.
A Yes result means that the value is what you
expect it to be. If you thought the water elemental
would do 1d6 damage, then it does 1d6 damage.
An Exceptional Yes result means the statistic
value is about 25% higher than you expected. In
this case, you might decide that the elemental
does 1d8 damage instead.
A No result means the NPC statistic is about
25% lower than you expected. In this case, you
might decide that the water elemental’s attack
does 1d4 damage.
An Exceptional No means the statistic is much
lower than expected, about 50% lower. In this
case, you might decide that the elemental does
1d3 damage.

# SOURCEBOOKS

I love a good sourcebook. There’s something
exciting about a resource chock full of content
and the knowledge that any of those ideas could
find their way into your adventure. It can be
anything that offers content for your adventure:
settings books, RPG core books, supplemental
rules, and the like.
The use of a sourcebook may seem obvious
when you have a Game Master running an
adventure. They will likely mine the book
for story hooks, adventure seeds, characters,
creatures, settings, and more. While a solo
Player will do the same, there are other, less
obvious ways to put a sourcebook to work for
solo role-playing.
For instance, maybe you play your adventures
using Mythic as your only rules, but you like to
incorporate the flavored content of published
RPGs. Since you aren’t using a specific RPG
ruleset, you could use books from unconnected
products—spells from one game, magic items
from another, and dungeon traps from a third.
It’s easier to mix and match RPG products when
playing solo, giving you more options for possible
sourcebooks for your adventures.

## Sourcebooks don’t have to be RPG related.

I keep a book of monsters from one of my
favorite sci-fi television shows on my gaming
shelf. It’s an excellent sourcebook full of photos,
descriptions, situations the creatures have
appeared in, how they were dealt with, etc.
There is nothing role-playing about this book,
yet it’s a wonderful resource. I can randomly
choose a creature from the book and generate its
stats as I play.
Solo role-play relies heavily on improvisation,
not only with the content of our adventures but
also sometimes with the rules and mechanics
themselves. This makes it easier to add non-RPG
material into our adventures and convert them on
the fly into game mechanics.
While we’re talking about leveraging sourcebooks
for solo adventures, I’d like to make a distinction
between the two general ways they might be
used. The way I see it, a sourcebook is either
going to be inspirational or practical.
By inspirational, I mean that the book gives us
ideas that spark our imagination, even if we don’t
use the specific ideas themselves. For example,
you might like the setting of a graphic novel,
so you use a heavily customized version for
your own adventure setting. That would be an
inspirational sourcebook.
A practical sourcebook, in my view, is one you use
material from directly. These are RPG books with
statblocked monsters or specific settings where
you follow the descriptions as written. The details
are all there, and you import them into your
adventure largely as-is.
INSPIRATIONAL VS. PRACTICAL
128128

# VARIATIONS

World Building
A sourcebook can offer a ready-made world for
your Characters to inhabit. Maybe you’re using
the default setting detailed in an RPG book,
or perhaps you’re taking inspiration from your
new favorite streaming television show. Having a
reference point for the adventure universe makes
creating the first Scene that much easier.
There’s even more world-building we can get
out of sourcebooks, however.


---

# POPULATING LISTS

If you’re going to use a sourcebook to create a
setting for your Player Character, then you may
want to consider pre-filling some of the Lists
before you start the first Scene, especially the
Characters List.
Let’s say you’re playing a Character in a weird
west style of adventure. You’re using Mythic for
the mechanics, but you’ve chosen a popular RPG
as a sourcebook of strange and supernatural old
west ideas. You’ve decided this is going to be your
setting and picked out a town detailed in the
book, reading up on some of the more interesting
features to be found there.
The bits you find most interesting could be
added to your Lists. You might put the town
itself on the Characters List in an entry like “The
people of Raven Gulch.” Maybe the sheriff is an
important figure in town, so you add “Sheriff
Turner” to the List. Maybe your sourcebook
mentions that the local gold mines are thought
to be haunted, and you add “Haunted mines” to
include them in your adventure. Now you have
some interesting elements at play before you’ve
even begun playing.


---

# MAKING THE FIRST SCENE

There are lots of ways of coming up with
a good opening Scene (as discussed in the
“Scenes” chapter). A good sourcebook can do
the work for you.
Maybe your source is a published adventure
module. You don’t plan to use the adventure
itself, but you like the setup. You could use the
beginning of the module as the first Scene of
your adventure, populating your Threads and
Characters Lists with elements from that section,
and then proceed with a fully solo, Mythic-driven
adventure. It may go in a completely different
direction from what the published adventure
intended, but that content-rich start provided an
excellent opening.


---

# SOURCING VALUABLE DETAILS


### Sourcebooks are treasure troves of valuable

elements that don’t even have to be tied to the
type of adventure you’re running to be useful.
For instance, maybe you’re playing a futuristic
adventure set in an apocalypse, but a wonderful
fantasy map from an adventure module fits that
world’s geography perfectly.
One of the many strengths of solo role-playing
is that we only have ourselves to please. You
get to decide what rules to use, what elements
to bring into our adventures, what to combine,
and how to combine them. You can choose to
use the weaponry from an RPG about space-
faring merchants, the Found Items table from a
game about zombie rampage, and the Riding on
Dragons rules from your favorite fantasy game,
tying all these disparate elements together using
Mythic Fate Questions.
While I’m using the term “book” a lot, sourcebooks
can come in any form. You can source material
from online blogs, magazine articles, music, the
    summaries of your favorite television shows ...
anything you want.

# OTHER MEDIA

### Detailed encounters are another valuable

resource you can pull from published adventures.
The encounters in various locations are all meant
to serve the narrative of the module, but they
can also be sourced for solo role-playing and
repurposed for custom use.

## Sourcebooks As A Tool

Not only is a sourcebook a repository of great
ideas, it can also be treated like a game element
itself, such as a table or other random resource.


---

# RANDOMLY DETERMINING


---

# YOUR SOURCE

This idea may seem strange, but it’s how I
start most of my solo games, and I love it. I have
several shelves of sourcebooks and role-playing
books, and when I’m ready for a brand new
adventure, I’ll roll to determine which bookcase,
which shelf, and which book on the shelf will be
my primary source for this adventure. This turns
my bookshelves into giant random tables.
Making the act of sourcebook selection itself
a randomized part of the adventure is a fun way
to play before you start playing, allowing you to
world-build randomly.

# BOOKS AS RANDOM TABLES


### Treating sourcebooks as random tables is a

good way to spark your imagination. A book is
practically designed for this, with page numbers
conveniently similar to numbers on a table.
Let’s say you’ve chosen an RPG about space
exploration as your sourcebook. To get inspiration
for your adventure, you roll a random page and
land on a section about the various colonies found
throughout the settled galaxy. You can use this
information as inspiration for the world your
Player Character comes from.
Find the last page of useful material in the
book and treat that number as the dice range.
For example, I have a sourcebook on battlefield
warfare for my fantasy RPG. The book has about
255 pages, but the content that is useful for my
adventure ends at page 250. I would consider the
random range to be 1-250.
You could roll for a random page in this range
using a d4 to establish the hundreds digit (treating
3 as 0 and rerolling a 4) and a d100 for the tens
and ones digits. Alternatively, you could use a
numbers generator app to work within the exact
range. If you roll up something useless for your
adventure, like a “How to Use This Book” page,
you simply reroll. Once you have the page, you
can select the content on that page that makes the
most sense in the current Context to incorporate
into your adventure.

### Using sourcebooks as random tables like this

provides interesting opportunities to inject their
contents into an adventure in unexpected ways.
You could even include the sourcebook itself in
your adventure’s Characters List, putting the
title of the book as a Character. Whenever this
“Character” gets rolled for a Random Event,
you would randomly select a page and use an
element from that page as the basis for that
Random Event.
Remember that the Characters List is meant
to include any element in your adventure that
can interact with your Character in some way;
it doesn’t have to be an actual NPC. In this
case, we are treating a sourcebook as a Character
and a randomly determined element from the
sourcebook as inspiration for the Random Event.
The Player Character is a sorceress accompanying
a warband as they try to defend their land from
invaders. The adventure is war themed, and
the Scenes so far have involved the PC going on
missions with the soldiers.
In the current Scene, the Player Character is
traveling with a swordsman as they search the
forest for signs of the enemy army. It’s near
evening, and there’s a light dusting of snow on the
ground. They move cautiously, mindful that the
enemy might be near.

## In the course of asking a Fate Question, the

Player generates a Random Event with a Focus
of NPC Action. Rolling on the Characters List
for the NPC, the Player gets “Fantastic Battles”,
the title of a sourcebook they added to the
List. The first 300 pages have lots of good
content, so the Player rolls for a page and gets
62. The Player turns to that page and finds it
has a list of backgrounds for characters. One
of the backgrounds, about outlaws who have
to scavenge for themselves, stands out to
the Player, and they decide to use that as the
inspirational element for the Event.

### Rolling on the Event Meaning Tables to help

interpret this Random Event, the Player gets
“Assist” and “Tactic”. They interpret this to mean
that a refugee from one of the war-torn towns
nearby comes upon the PC. This person has been
foraging in the woods, stealing supplies from
the invading armies to get by. He spotted the PC
scouting and wants to assist, saying he knows
where the enemy is and where they are going.

You never know where a Mythic adventure
will take you. Usually this is exciting, exploring
the unknown with your Player Character.
Sometimes, though, it can be frustrating: you
want a more linear narrative to play out, but
Mythic just isn’t cooperating.
You can use the Thread Progress Track to
focus your adventure on a target goal and keep
things moving toward a conclusion.
Focus Thread
Choose a Thread you want to focus on and
make it the goal of your Thread Progress Track.
Don’t remove the Thread from the Threads List—
it can still be called upon by Random Events.

## By copying the chosen Thread as a Focus

Thread, you’re allowing the Thread Progress
Track to have some control over your adventure to
ensure that the Thread reaches a conclusion.

## You can choose at any time to start a Thread

Progress Track. Maybe you do it as soon as you
add the Thread to your adventure, or maybe you
do it later, after you’ve decided you want it to be
the main Thread you focus on.

## The Thread Progress Track

Use a Thread Progress Track form (you can
find the forms on this page and the next, and
also collected on a single page at the back of
the book) to keep track of your progress toward
concluding the Thread you are focusing on.
There are three Tracks to choose from, each with
a different range of Progress Points: 10, 15, and

Once you’ve chosen a Focus Thread and
started a Thread Progress Track, keep a running

off on the Track. Progress Points are earned by
achieving Progress and experiencing Flashpoint
events. You can’t complete the Thread until you

# YOUR ADVENTURE


## Apart from the special rules of the Thread

Progress Track, your Mythic game continues as
normal, and the Thread you chose as the Focus still
operates like any other Thread in the adventure. It’s
up to you how much of your attention you want
to spend actively pursuing that Thread, but given
the nature of the Thread Progress Track, you will
experience the Focus Thread one way or another as
your adventure continues.
Progress

## Progress is the term used when your Player

Character takes a significant step toward
completing the Focus Thread while playing out a
Scene. Making Progress is important, as it’s what
moves you along the Track and brings you closer
to the Conclusion.
The Player’s modern mage Character has set out
on a quest to restore the manna of a fellow mage
whose powers were drained by an otherworldly
creature. The Thread representing this goal is
“Restore Bakra’s manna.” The Player decides to
start a Thread Progress Track with this Thread as
the Focus Thread.
In a later Scene, the PC learns about Fay Jars,
containers meant to imprison supernatural
creatures. Since this discovery represents a
significant step toward resolving the current
Thread, the Player counts it as Progress. When
the PC successfully makes a Fay Jar a few Scenes
later, the Player counts this as further Progress.
Any Scene that moves the Player Character
significantly closer to resolving the Focus
Thread should be considered Progress, though
you get to decide exactly what does and doesn’t
count. Making Progress awards 2 Progress
Points on the Thread Progress Track; cross out
the numbered boxes as you go to keep track of
your current Progress.

Flashpoint

## A Flashpoint is an important moment in a

Scene that’s related to the Focus Thread. They
can be initiated through normal Mythic play, a
Random Event involving the Thread, or through
the Thread Progress Track.
A Flashpoint is very similar to Progress, with
one key difference: a Flashpoint event should
be dramatic and important. You can consider
this part of the Context when interpreting a
Flashpoint event.
During a Scene, the Player’s mage PC finds the
place where the creature has taken up residence:
in the high-end apartment of a tech millionaire.

## She attempts to trap the creature in the Fay

Jar in a frantic chase through the apartment,
destroying furniture and valuables as the
creature, a small, elf-like humanoid, runs and
flies about.
This encounter is dramatic, directly involves
the Focus Thread, and offers hope of eventually
resolving the Thread. It has all the qualities to
make it a Flashpoint.
A Flashpoint awards 2 Progress Points on
the Thread Progress Track, just like standard
Progress. Make sure to check off the box next to
“Did A Flashpoint Happen?” for that phase of the
Progress Track.

## A Flashpoint happens when your Player

The Thread Progress Track is broken into
phases of 5 Progress Points each. If a Flashpoint
hasn’t happened by the end of a phase, then a
Flashpoint event is triggered. Treat this like a

## The Player Character made Progress toward the Thread of “Restore


## Bakra’s manna” by learning about Fay Jars, earning 2 Progress Points.

In a later Scene they successfully constructed a jar, earning another 2
points for a total of 4 Progress Points so far.
Making Progress and experiencing a Flashpoint
are very similar. Both involve the Focus Thread
in a meaningful way: Progress is anything that
moves you closer to resolving the Focus Thread,
while a Flashpoint is specifically a dramatic,
important event that involves the Focus Thread.

## A moment in a Scene can count as both

Progress and a Flashpoint. In these cases,
you can choose which to call it. Either earns
you 2 Progress Points, though having a
Flashpoint event means another Flashpoint
won’t automatically happen when you cross the
threshold of a Phase.
You can let the drama and tension of the Scene
help you decide if the event was a Progress or
a Flashpoint. Discovering the recipe for making
Fay Jars by studying a book isn’t very dramatic,
but it is forward motion, so that’s Progress.
Encountering the creature and battling it was
dramatic and tense, so that’s a Flashpoint.
IS IT PROGRESS OR A FLASHPOINT?

## Discovery Checks

Progress along the Track is usually made by
the Player Character through normal Mythic
play. The Player is seeking to resolve the Thread,
so they take steps to do so, just like you would in
any Mythic adventure.
But what happens if you run out of ideas for
how to proceed? The point of the Thread Progress
Track is to keep the Focus Thread active, so we
need a way to push forward when the adventure
stalls. Enter the Discovery Check, a special kind
of Fate Question for making Progress when you
don’t know where to look for it.
To make a Discovery Check, your Player
Character has to do something to trigger it. This
can be anything that presents an opportunity
to make a discovery: reaching out to a contact,
consulting a book, or even just waiting for
something to happen. Then you can ask the Fate
Question, “Is something discovered?” assigning

## Odds based on the current Context.

The more contextually appropriate the action,
the better the chances of discovering something
useful, but unlike a regular Fate Question, the
Odds can never be worse than 50/50 regardless
of what the PC does. Narratively speaking,
this encourages your PC to put genuine effort
into seeking out a discovery, but even the most
low-effort attempt on their part gives them a
decent shot at finding something. The goal of
the Discovery Check is to get the action moving
again, so results are biased in the PC’s favor to
some degree.

### Consult the Discovery Fate Question Table for

an explanation of the Fate Question answers.
After successfully building a Fay Jar, the Player’s
mage Character failed to capture the creature
during her chaotic encounter with it in the
apartment. Now she’s stuck, unsure how else to
move toward resolving the Thread. It’s time to
try for a Discovery Check.

## Restore Bakra’s manna

The Player Character had an encounter with the supernatural
creature she’s trying to capture. The Player decides that since this
event was dramatic and had the potential to resolve the Focus Thread
that it’s more important than just Progress, it’s a Flashpoint. The
Player marks off 2 more Progress Points, raising the total to 6, and
checks the “Did A Flashpoint Happen?” box for this phase. Getting to
6 Progress Points passed the 5 point threshold that would trigger a
Flashpoint. However, the Player had decided that a Flashpoint event
had just occurred in this Scene so another one isn’t triggered.
✘
✘
✘
You can record Progress Points at any time,
whether during the Scene as you play or after
the Scene as part of your regular end-of-Scene
Bookkeeping. When you mark it down may
depend on when you think to do so. Maybe the
action of the Scene was so exciting that you didn’t
stop to consider if it was Progress or a Flashpoint
until after the Scene was over.
The timing of when you record Progress Points
only matters if they trigger a Flashpoint. If you’re
recording Progress Points as a Scene plays out,
and you cross the threshold between phases
that triggers a Flashpoint, you can generate the
Flashpoint right then. This is a lot like when a

## Random Event is triggered by a Fate Question.

If a Flashpoint is triggered when you’re recording
your Progress Points as part of Bookkeeping,
then it will occur at the start of your next Scene.
You will still generate the next Scene normally,
coming up with an Expected Scene and testing it
to see if it’s Altered or Interrupted, but however
the Scene pans out, it will still include the
Flashpoint event. Once you’ve started the Scene,
you can roll for the specifics of the Flashpoint to
see what happens.

The PC already checked her library for clues in
a previous Scene, so as far as attempts to trigger
a Discovery Check go, going over her books
again is pretty low effort. The Player decides
that checking the library gives her 50/50 Odds
to successfully discover something. Under normal
circumstances, they would have given this
Question Odds of Very Unlikely, but the Odds of
a Discovery Check can’t go below 50/50, so those

# CHECK TABLE

A successful Discovery Check earns you a roll

### Table. This will tell you what aspect of the Focus

Thread to hone in on and what bonus you receive
on the Progress Track.

### To roll on the Thread Discovery Check Table,

roll 1d10, add the current number of Progress

just like with a Random Event, roll on the Event

help you interpret the Discovery.

2 or 3 Progress Points.
Flashpoint +2 / +3: You discover something
that involves the Focus Thread in an important
and dramatic way, giving you 2 or 3 Progress
Points in the process.
The Discovery Check is a mechanic designed to
kickstart a stalled adventure and get it moving
again. It doesn’t take much action on the part of
the Player Character to make a Discovery Check,
but whatever they do should have narrative
meaning. “I stare out the window and hope that
something happens” is no fun. “I review the clues
again to look for something I missed” is better.
Not only do better reasons make for better
narratives, but they should also give you better

on the Thread Discovery Check Table and the

Remember, however, that if the Thread Discovery

### Check Table indicates this Event is a Flashpoint,

then it should be dramatic and important.
The mage Player Character hits her arcane books
again, looking for any information she might
have missed that could help. Her Player asks the
Discovery Check Fate Question, and the answer
is Yes. This means they get to roll on the Thread

### Discovery Check Table to see what happens.

With Progress Points currently at 6, the Player
rolls 1d10+6 and gets a total of 8, a result of
“Progress +2”. They choose the Actions Meaning

### Tables to roll on and get “Imitate” and “Failure”.

The Player interprets the results this way: Re-
reading her books, the mage discovers a story she
previously missed. It tells of a sorcerer long ago who
dealt with a manna stealing imp and noted that
the creatures are almost always drawn back to the
locations where they consumed a source of manna.
This is excellent news for the mage. She knows
where her friend was attacked, and if this
information is correct, then going back to that
place may provide another chance to capture
the creature.
The Player marks off 2 more Progress Points
and prepares for the next Scene, now with a way
forward in mind.
Plot Armor
The goal of the Thread Progress Track is to
give Mythic a way to help you progress toward
the completion of a Thread. While the end is
achievable, you have to reach milestones along the
way, such as Flashpoints, to get to it. This means
you can’t resolve the Thread until you’ve reached
the full amount of Progress Points and engaged in
the Conclusion.

## Plot Armor is the rule that protects the


## Thread until you reach the Conclusion.

Consider it Context that says: “The Thread
cannot be resolved until the Conclusion.”
Normal Mythic play or Flashpoints cannot
end the Thread before its time. No matter
what happens in a Scene, Plot Armor requires
intervention in any case that would cause the
Thread to be completed early.
We know the mage hunting the manna-
thieving imp won’t capture it in the apartment
Scene because we haven’t reached the Conclusion
yet in the Thread Progress Track. Let’s say
there’s a moment when the Player Character has
the upper hand and is about to bring the Fay
Jar down on the creature. At the last second,
the PC trips on a lamp that was knocked over
during the chaos. She falls to the floor, the Jar
rolling across the carpet, as the creature flies out
a window and escapes.

# CLOSE A THREAD


## Plot Armor also protects the Thread from a


## Random Event with an Event Focus of Close A

Thread. Play out the Random Event as normal but
with the extra Context that the Thread will not
actually be closed. The Random Event may look
like it’s going to close the Thread, but it doesn’t.
The mage PC is at a secret nightclub for magical
folk and supernatural creatures in the city. She
hopes to find a certain shaman who allegedly has
had experience with manna-thieving fay.
During this Scene, the Player rolls a Random

## Event with an Event Focus of Close A Thread.


## The Thread invoked is the same as the Focus

Thread.

### The Player rolls on the Event Meaning tables as

usual and interprets the Random Event as this:
someone comes up to the Player Character and
says that the shaman is in a back room and has
already captured the fay.
The Player plays out the Scene, knowing
that Plot Armor will prevent this Event from
concluding the Thread. They ask the Fate
Question “Did they lie?”, giving it Odds of
Nearly Certain, to determine what actually
happens and interprets the Yes to mean that the
mage is attacked when she gets to the back room
by mages who are also trying to track down the
manna thief. They want to take the power it’s
collected for themselves, and attacking the PC is
an attempt to remove competition.
This idea of Plot Armor is a heavy-handed
approach to guiding the narrative, especially for
Mythic, where events are generally guided by
Questions and expectations.
When protecting a Thread with Plot Armor, you
know ahead of time that the Player Character
won’t be able to resolve the Thread until all the
Progress Points are scored. This means you
already know how Scenes that involve the Thread
Focus are going to turn out—or at least, how they
won’t turn out. But even though you approach
Scenes with this knowledge, you still don’t know
exactly how the Scenes will play out. Sure, your
Character won’t resolve the Thread this Scene,
but what else might happen? What will failure to
resolve the Thread look like?

## I encourage you to have fun with Plot Armor.

The Thread Progress Track is meant to apply a
cinematic experience to tackling a Thread, giving
you more of a hand in directing the outcome of
some Scenes.

## When deciding how Plot Armor intervenes in your

Scenes, follow the Context and what you expect
might happen to keep a Thread from being
resolved early. If you don’t have a clear idea in
mind, roll on the Meaning Tables for inspiration.

Conclusion
The goal of the Thread Progress Track is to
make enough Progress and encounter enough
dramatic Flashpoint moments to finally reach
the Conclusion and have the opportunity to
resolve the Thread. You arrive at the Conclusion
by scoring the full Progress Points on the Thread
Progress Track (10, 15, or 20 Points, depending
on the Track you select).

## You can think of this Conclusion as a


## Flashpoint with the Plot Armor removed. The

Focus Thread is no longer protected and can now,
finally, be resolved. The Conclusion event should
be dramatic and important, just like a Flashpoint,
giving the Player Character the opportunity to
finally close the Thread.

## Like a Flashpoint that’s triggered by the

Thread Progress Track, the Conclusion is also
treated like a Random Event. The Event Focus
is automatically Current Context: this is the
Conclusion, Plot Armor is gone, and the event

to end the Thread. Choose a Meaning Table to

# DELAYING THE CONCLUSION

If it’s possible for the Conclusion to happen
when the Progress Points trigger it, then have it
happen right then, in the midst of that Scene.
However, given all the circumstances that may be
involved in making the Conclusion happen, the
event may not fit into the current moment. In this
case, delay the Conclusion to the next Scene.
If you delay the Conclusion, then come up
with an Expected Scene as you normally would,
including the details of the Conclusion. Don’t test
the Expected Scene against the Chaos Factor—
since the Thread Progress Track has triggered a
Conclusion, it guarantees that the Expected Scene
will begin as you imagine it.

in capturing the thieving fay and has made more
Fay Jars to contain it. The Player has racked up
In an adventure involving returning two demons back to the Netherworld,

all revolving around trying to get the two hellspawn in the same room
together so the exorcism could be cast. The Conclusion event involves all
the factors finally coming into place.

At the moment, the PC is in a meeting with her
friends, plotting their strategy to ambush the

Player thinks it wouldn’t be appropriate to have
the Conclusion just yet, so they delay it until the
next Scene.
When the Scene about the meeting has ended,
the Player comes up with the next Expected
Scene, fashioning it around the Conclusion to the
Thread Progress Track. They decide on this: The
mage and her allies camp out at the site Bakra
was attacked, ready to pounce on the creature
when it returns. There is no need to test this
Expected Scene against the Chaos Factor since
this is a delayed Conclusion to the Track.

## A smuggler captain Player Character has docked


## The Star Nautilus at a space port to resupply.

While there, the captain hears a rumor about
a scientist seeking safe passage to the outer rim.
They set up a meeting with the scientist, who says
the Syndicate, a harsh regime controlling many
planets in the region, has operatives pursuing
him. He’ll pay the captain good credits to get
him where he wants to go safely. The PC decides
to take the job.
The Player adds the Thread “Transport the
scientist” to the Threads List. All done!
Or is it?

## The above example seems clear and simple.

The Player Character comes across a goal that
sounds interesting, ferrying a scientist to a distant
planet, so the Player turns it into a new Thread.

### But why stop there? You might be able to

summarize a Thread with a single sentence but
you can make a Thread more impactful in your
adventure by breaking it up into multiple Threads.
In the example the Player added the Thread
“Transport the scientist.” That works fine and
any Random Event that involves that Thread
has a lot of Context built into it: Move Away
From A Thread may mean the PC’s ship is under
attack by the pursuing agents forcing you to find
a longer, safer way to your destination. A Move
Toward A Thread result may involve the scientist
divulging why he is being hunted, revealing
something interesting and helpful.
Threads often have lots of meaning packed
into a simple summary and that meaning gets
unpacked as you experience Random Events and
make interpretations during your adventure.
However, you can make this task easier on
yourself by breaking a single Thread into multiple
Threads, essentially unpacking its Context in
Considering all the Progress and Flashpoint events
the Player Character has gone through to get to
the end of a Thread Progress Track, they are well
poised to finish the Thread during the Conclusion
in a dramatic and satisfying way. However, it’s
possible that the Thread won’t be closed during
the Conclusion. It’s not guaranteed; it’s just a very
good opportunity for it. Even though this is the
Conclusion, the Scene may play out in such a way
that the Thread is not actually closed.
Regardless of what happens, the Thread Progress
Track is considered completed. Rules pertaining
to the Focus Thread, including Plot Armor, no
longer apply, and the Thread is treated like any
other Thread. If the Player Character fails to
conclude the Thread during the Conclusion, then
the Thread will continue to exist on the Mythic
Threads List like any other thread to be resolved
through normal Mythic play.

advance. For instance, in the above example the
Player could have added the following Threads:
 » Transport the scientist
 » Find out why he’s being hunted
 » Avoid the Syndicate
That’s three Threads, each a little different
from the others but all part of the same whole.
The first one is the primary Thread while the
second two are aspects of it.

## Breaking a Thread up can make for richer

Random Events by having a more focused topic
to interpret. Rolling the Thread of “Avoid the
Syndicate” tells you that this Random Event will
involve the Syndicate in some way. The more
detailed Thread narrows the Context allowing
you to make a more granular interpretation with
this result than you might otherwise have done.

One of the greatest wonders of solo role-playing,
in my opinion, is the ability to play a role-playing
game completely by yourself and yet still be
surprised by what happens. You aren’t limited by
a linear storyline pre-determined by an author or
guide, the scope is unlimited. All you have to do is
ask Questions and keep moving forward.
Still, despite our best intentions, sometimes
the surprises can be spoiled when we, the Players,
know more than our Characters do. There are
lots of ways this can happen, and if you aren’t
prepared to deal with it you may find yourself
sitting in the middle of a solo gaming session
suddenly puzzling over how your Character
should act when you know something they don’t.

# VARIATIONS

At Its Simplest
When Mythic is played at its simplest the issue
of Character knowledge vs. Player knowledge is
handled automatically. Mythic is intended to act
as the Gamemaster for you. You know things, and
don’t know things, depending on what Mythic
reveals just as it would be with a live GM.
For instance, your thief Player Character
slipping into an ancient catacomb to rob a long-
dead king’s grave may not have any idea what to
expect to find in the dark depths, and neither will
you. You’ll find out by asking Fate Questions and
learning as your Character learns.

## It’s tempting when playing this way to ask

Questions for information outside the scope of
your Character. For instance, while your thief
is making his way into the catacombs, out of
curiosity you ask “Is the place haunted?” There
are circumstances where this Question would
make sense to ask, but given the current Context
of the thief entering the tomb there is no basis
to ask this Question. Getting an answer now
would be information that the Player knows
and the Character does not, and doesn’t give a
good mechanism for the Player to act on that
knowledge now.
Keeping things at their simplest, just asking
the Questions that make the most sense and that
only your Character could know, is the easiest
way I know to sidestep the Player vs. Character
knowledge problem.

## When It’s No Longer Simple

The thing is, not every solo adventure stays this
simple. There are lots of ways you, as the Player,
can learn things that your Character doesn’t know.
For instance, if you are soloing your way
through a published module you may already
know a ton of things your Character doesn’t know.
Also, how about resolving social skills like telling
if someone is lying, or doing things like finding
secret doors or hidden compartments? Should you
already know such secret places exist before your

## Character searches for them?

Let’s go over some of these less simple situations
and review strategies for handling them.
TEST IT, ASK IT, THEN IT’S REAL
How do you resolve a Player Character
searching for something that a Game Master
would know is there but you, the solo Player, do
not? Secret doors are a good example, but it could
be anything from evidence of a crime to figuring
out if an NPC is lying.

# KNOWLEDGE STRATEGIES

# VARIATIONS

I think the best way to deal with this dilemma
is for the Character to first try and discover the
hidden thing, either using the rules of your chosen

## RPG or posing it as a Mythic Fate Question.

For instance, your warrior searches a room for
a secret door or your espionage Player Character
studies his informant to determine if he’s telling
the truth. In an adventure guided by a Game
Master you would make such a discovery roll to
find if something hidden is there. In this case,
you are making the roll to find if the possibility of
something hidden is there.
If you succeed at the test then you know
that the hidden thing is discovered if it exists.
Determine if the secret thing exists by posing it as
a Fate Question. “Does my warrior find a secret
door?” “Do I get the sense that he’s lying?”

# INFORMATION

Given enough time and enough Questions you’re
going to know a lot of details about a lot of things
pertaining to your adventure. This is where Player
knowledge may expand past your Character’s.
In an adventure about teenagers dealing with
otherworldly forces, over the course of a dozen
Scenes the Player has worked out where the
creatures in the woods come from. At some point
while asking Fate Questions the Player discovered
who was responsible for letting the creatures into
our dimension, an important piece of information
that their Character doesn’t know yet.
If the Player gets to a Scene where it’s important
for their Character to know who is responsible
for the creature crisis how does the Player deal
with this? The Player already knows the answer,
which robs the tension in deciding if their

## Character is going to trust the NPC or not.

One way to deal with this dilemma is
accepting that something you, the Player, learned
earlier in the adventure might be wrong.
For instance, in the example above let’s say the
Player determined earlier that the high school
science teacher, Mr. Larkins, is responsible for
bringing the creatures into the world. He was using
machinery found in an abandoned lab when his
experiment to speak with the dead inadvertently
opened a portal into a chaotic dimension.
Now, later in the adventure, the Player
Character is in a Scene with Mr. Larkin and has
to decide whether to trust him. This might be
disappointing for you since you already know
Larkin is secretly responsible for the catastrophe
and is going to great lengths to cover it up.

## To maintain the tension in this Scene the

Player could decide that Mythic might have been
wrong earlier. The only way to confirm it for sure
is for your Player Character to discover it through
normal play.
This is treating information in your
adventure as either reliable or unreliable. Reliable
information are facts your Player Character
discovers within the adventure, and unreliable
information are facts only the Player knows.

### Unreliable facts are only possibilities until they are

made reliable by becoming part of a Scene.

## By assuming that everything you know as the

Player that your Character doesn’t know is
unreliable information is a way to bring tension
back into an adventure that may otherwise have
become too predictable.
This strategy is going to appeal mostly to
simulationist Players who love surprises from
their adventures. Cinematic Players, who are
more interested in constructing a story, probably
aren’t going to be as concerned with knowing
things their PC’s don’t. In fact, knowing more may
be a feature to them instead of a flaw.

# GOING WITH IT


## Solo role-playing styles differ among Players.

Some of us want a realistic, simulationist feel from
our games. Others want a more narrative driven,
cinematic experience.
If cinematic is your style then having greater
knowledge than your Player Character may not
be a problem. The more you, the Player, know the
more cohesively you can guide events. You may
know the space station’s reactor was sabotaged by
rebels, and while your Character may not know
this your superior knowledge allows you to design

## Expected Scenes that grow the narrative.

In this case you may go with it when you
know more than your Character because you are
more interested in how the narrative as a whole
comes together than you are with surprises.
Going with being the omniscient observer is a
stylistic choice that makes for good cinematic or
literary narratives.
Embracing Player knowledge over Character
knowledge offers its own kind of excitement,
where you know your PC is trusting the wrong
people, is walking toward an ambush, is being
tricked by a foe, and you go with it because
you understand that Character and what they
would do. Knowing more in this Context is like
watching a movie where your omniscience serves
to heighten the tension because you know the
Character is making a mistake.


---

# EXTRA KNOWLEDGE AS


---

# AN RP OPPORTUNITY


## That extra knowledge you have that your

Character doesn’t can be used as a role-playing
opportunity. It’s an indicator that your Character
should have a chance to earn that knowledge.
This approach calls for allowing your PC to
make some kind of check to see if they discover
the knowledge that you know.
For instance with that Character who is
about to walk into a trap that you are aware
of, maybe grant them a skill roll that the RPG
you’re using allows to see if they detect the
trap. If you know that the NPC they just met is
secretly an undead sorcerer disguised as a living
human you could give your PC the chance to
see if they figure it out.
The knowledge gap becomes a trigger where
you automatically allow the Player Character
a chance to find out. Player knowledge isn’t a
hindrance to adventure surprise, it’s a doorway
to role-playing gold. Your Character can’t act
on your superior knowledge unless they earn
it somehow, but that extra knowledge gives
them the chance to earn it when they otherwise
wouldn’t have had that chance.
This strategy is a middle ground between the
more simulationist “Test It, Ask It, Then It’s Real”
and the cinematic “Going With It” approaches.

One of the great things about Mythic is it spins
your adventures in new and unexpected directions.
One of the worst things about Mythic? It spins
your adventures in new and unexpected directions.
Once you begin a solo adventure you don’t
know where it will lead. The adventure will branch
out and grow in complexity. While the beginning
and the middle are sure to happen, getting your
adventure to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion
is less guaranteed. Here are some suggestions
for how to make sure your adventure ends
conclusively and in a way that you will remember.

## Move Toward A Thread

Sometimes a solid conclusion to a solo adventure
can feel out of reach because of lack of progress
on your primary Thread of interest. Maybe you’ve
gone five Scenes in your post apocalypse adventure
where your Player Character has failed to make
any headway on figuring out why people from his
settlement are disappearing. Lots of other things
have happened in the adventure: you helped stop
an attempted robbery, you assisted in stopping a
small riot over food rationing, and you recovered
lost horses that ran off during a storm.
But the main storyline of getting to the
bottom of why people have been disappearing
has stalled and you see no conclusive end to
this adventure in sight.
One way to keep your adventure on
track toward a conclusion is to use
the rules in the “Random Events”
chapter about choosing an Event
Focus. When you generate an
Interrupt Scene and you feel
your adventure needs to be
dragged back on track you
could choose to select Move Toward A Thread as
the Event Focus instead of rolling for the Focus.
You might want to go one step further and
not only choose the Event Focus but also choose
the Thread to make sure this next Scene is about
progress toward the main adventure goal.
You probably wouldn’t want to take this option
with every Interrupt Scene. “Choosing The Event
Focus” gives guidelines on how often to take
control of an Event Focus. It may take only once
to bring an adventure back on point.

## With our post apocalypse example the Player

Character, Oscar Bright, is trying to figure
out why people are disappearing. The Player
considers this to be their main Thread: “Solve
the mystery of the disappearances.” Although a lot
has been going on in this adventure the Player
feels stuck on how to proceed with the main
Thread. They just haven’t found any leads and
aren’t sure where to look next.
The Player is about eight Scenes into their
adventure and just wrapped up a Scene where
the PC succeeded in capturing a group of thieves
who tried to raid the
settlement’s supply

keeper to do when he wants
to find missing people but
crises keep getting in the way?

stores. The next Expected Scene is about visiting
the jail to question the robbers.

## The Player tests the Expected Scene against the


## Chaos Factor and it comes back as Interrupted.

Since the Player hasn’t chosen an Event Focus
yet in this adventure, and they don’t know how
to proceed with the main Thread, they decide
to choose the Event Focus for this Interrupt
instead of rolling for it. The Player selects
Move Toward A Thread and goes the extra
step of also selecting the Thread of “Solve the
mystery of the disappearances.”
The Player completes the Interrupt Random Event
by rolling on the Meaning Tables for inspiration
and gets “Inform” and “Enemy”.

## The Player interprets the results this way:

Oscar enters the jail where the three thieves are
slumped in a cell. Before he questions them one
starts talking about how they had to steal the
settlement’s food and supplies because another
group has been stealing theirs. This is new
information as the PC wasn’t aware there was
another community operating in the area. The
Player realizes this mystery group may be the ones
responsible for the missing townsfolk.
In this example the Player’s adventure took a
turn toward the main Thread because they pushed
a Move Toward A Thread Event. Without that
nudge the Scene might have involved the PC
questioning the thieves and moving the robbery
Thread along. With the nudge the robbery Thread
pivots and becomes linked to the main Thread of
solving the mystery of the missing people.
Make It Special
Maybe the problem isn’t getting to the end of
an adventure, it’s making that end feel powerful.
You can give the end of your adventure more
weight by making it special.

## This is more of an attitude than a rule.

When you know a Scene is heading toward the
completion of an important Thread, give it all
the emotional energy you can muster. Make
interpretations of Fate Questions more impactful,
have Characters act more dramatically, infuse the

## Scene with as much energy as you can.

This is the end of the Thread, so you can take
your foot off the narrative brakes and let loose.
Context is important in Mythic. Context informs
our expectations when making interpretations of
Mythic’s prompts.
Context can also apply to our expectations about
the meta aspects of the game. Wanting to make
the conclusion of your adventure special is,
itself, Context. You can use it to help power your
interpretations in this final Scene.
For instance, your warrior has caught up with the
dread lich Brizas for a final confrontation. This
is the Thread conclusion you’ve been working
toward. You’re not sure if Brizas will fight or flee,
so you ask the Fate Question, “Does he fight?”
and get a Yes.
In normal Context of this adventure, during
any other Scene, you might interpret this to
mean Brizas fires off an energy bolt. That’s a
standard attack for this NPC. But this Scene is the
conclusion and making it more dramatic is part of
the Context used for making interpretations.
With that Context in mind the Player may
interpret a Yes to mean Brizas unleashes his
most dramatic attack spell, The Agony Cries
Of A Thousand Souls. Normally you might only
have made this interpretation for such an all-out
attack if the Fate Question had come back with
Exceptional Yes. But this Scene isn’t a normal
Scene, it’s the apparent conclusion of a big
Thread. This encourages the Player to ramp up
their expectations.

## WHAT IS “A SESSION”

IN SOLO PLAY?
Many role-playing systems refer to a game
session as a unit of time with rules attached to
the completion of a session. For instance, maybe
experience points are distributed for each session
of play.

## In traditional group role-play guided by a

Game Master sessions tend to include enough
time to accomplish a goal, making it a good unit
of measurement for Player Character progress.
Solo role-playing sessions, however, aren’t
always so neatly divvied up. Every solo Player may
have their own approach to how long they play.
Many like to play for short periods of time as one
of the strengths of solo is starting and stopping
whenever you like. In short, the concept of a
“session” doesn’t mean the same thing in solo play
as it does in cooperative play.

So what is the best way for a solo Player to
decide what a session is when their chosen RPG
calls for it?
You might think that choosing a set number
of Scenes may be the way to go. For instance,
5 Scenes or 8 Scenes is a session. But just like
solo sessions vary in length so do Scenes making
it impossible to assume that 5 or 8 Scenes
encompasses the kind of goals one would expect
to complete in a session.
I think a better way to record the end
of a solo session is to look at meaning and
accomplishment.  If you end a Scene with your
Player Character having achieved a significant
adventure goal then that should constitute a
session, at least in terms of what your chosen
RPG is looking for.
Probably the easiest way to determine when
such a goal has been reached is when you
complete a Thread, especially an important
Thread. If you finish a Thread that is less
important maybe only consider it the end of a
session if it’s been a while since you’ve completed
your last session. This way easily accomplished
Threads that are achieved in a Scene or two don’t
necessarily trigger a session and any benefits that
come with it.
I think tying session rewards to Thread
accomplishment is an easier and more elegant way
to decide the end of a session than keeping track
of how much time you’ve spent or how many
Scenes have passed. If you play your solo games
in a patchwork fashion, maybe doing a few Scenes
before you go to work, then playing for an hour
on the weekend, maybe finishing a couple of
Scenes late at night, then the sum total of all that
adventuring becomes a meaningful session when
your PC achieves a Thread goal without the need
for additional bookkeeping specifically to identify
the session end.

narrative rules specific to your adventure using
Keyed Scenes.

## Removing the Chaos Factor completely from Fate

Questions makes for a simple Fate Chart and
no Chaos Factor modifiers to a Fate Check. You
may want this if you want Fate Questions to only
respond to the Odds.

## This is also a good option if you are using Fate

chosen RPG (see “Using Fate Questions To
Replace RPG Rules” on 28). In this case you
might use one Fate Chart or Fate Check Modifiers

the No-Chaos variety for game mechanics

## Questions like task resolution.


## If you remove the Chaos Factor from Fate

Questions you will still need to keep track of

## It comes into play when testing Expected


## Scenes and determining Random Events.


## If you want to reduce the influence of a shifting

Chaos Factor from those processes as well
you can restrict the range that the Chaos
Factor can shift to. For instance, if you want
the Chaos Factor to have less influence on
Expected Scenes and Random Events you
could restrict the Chaos Factor to a range of
3-7. If you want it to have even less control
then restrict it to 4-6 or always leave it at 5.

A Keyed Scene is a special event that sets a tone
to a Scene. You can tailor Keyed Scenes to any
trope or concept that you want.
Keyed Scenes allow you to control your
adventure in some interesting ways. For instance,
Keyed Scenes could be used as another way to
inject theme elements into your adventure. It
can also be used to guarantee that certain things
happen that you want to happen.
Let’s say you’re running a campaign in a
zombie apocalypse. You’ve had some good
adventures in this setting, but you’re unhappy
with how infrequently your Player Character is
running into zombies. You want more zombie
action. You could use Keyed Scenes to insert
zombie encounters into your adventure by
following certain rules that you set up.
These rules are called Triggers and they decide
when a Keyed Scene Event happens.

## Keyed Scene Trigger


## The Trigger is what tells you when a Keyed

Scene Event occurs. With a zombie adventure the
Trigger might be three Scenes that pass without
any zombie attacks taking place. After the third

## Scene ends without an encounter the Keyed Scene

Event is Triggered and the next Scene now must
contain the Keyed Scene Event, a zombie attack.
A Trigger can be just about anything. For a
dungeon delve maybe the Trigger is if you roll
a 6 on a 1d6 and the Keyed Scene Event is a
wandering monster encounter. For a superhero
trying to maintain control over their wild powers
the Trigger could be a total of 4 Scenes where
they use their powers at maximum and the Keyed
Scene Event is their powers suddenly raging out
of control. Maybe for an adventure that you are
trying to keep on a schedule your Trigger is one
hour of real time passing and the Keyed Scene

## Event is an automatic Move Toward A Thread

Random Event.
You can think of the Keyed Scene Trigger
as a sort of If/Then computer statement. If X
happens then Y happens. The Trigger can even
be something compound. For instance, let’s say
in our superhero adventure you like the idea that
after four times of maxing out your powers your

## You’re thirsting for an adventure with battle, this


## Keyed Scene will make it happen.

The Player Character is overwhelmed by what

apocalypse survivor you might have your idea for
the Expected Scene but you know that this Scene
is also a Keyed Scene and a zombie attack has to
take place in it, so you work that all together to
make the Scene.
The Keyed Scene Event should take place at
the beginning of the Scene, or as close to the
beginning as makes sense.

## Playing Keyed Scenes

The first step to utilizing a Keyed Scene is
deciding what you want to use it for (sidebars in
this section explore some Keyed Scene examples).
These are the Keyed Scene Events that you want
to happen in your adventure. Next you need to
decide the Trigger.

## When the Trigger is achieved in one Scene the

been digging around in a ruined city looking for
shelter and supplies. She previously ran into a
hostile group so she’s been keeping a low profile.
The PC has gone through three Scenes where
she’s scavenging and hiding and hasn’t run into
any zombies. This is the Keyed Scene Trigger
so the Player knows the next Scene will have a
zombie encounter.

## In the Scene where the Trigger happens the

Player Character escaped from the hostile
group who chased her through a wrecked office
building. The next Scene is the PC returning to
her shelter, a s fortified school classroom.
Since the Player knows that a zombie encounter
is going to happen she combines that with the
Expected Scene. As she returns to her shelter
she’s dismayed to find zombies outside the door,
blocking her.
You can use the Keyed Scenes Record Sheet on
the next page to keep track of your Keyed Scenes.

# USING RANDOM EVENTS

Keyed Scene Events are usually going to be
an idea or concept. Such as “zombie encounter”,
“ship malfunctions”, “plot moves forward”, etc.
When the Keyed Scene Trigger happens you
know its Event will take place in the next Scene,
but you don’t know exactly how it’s going to
unfold. To help shape how it happens you can turn
the Keyed Scene Event into a Random Event with
an automatic Event Focus of Current Context.
If the Keyed Scene Event is “Supervillain attacks!”
and the Player’s Expected Scene is their hero PC
investigating a dock where smuggling activity

## Checking for Keyed Scenes as part of end of

Scene Bookkeeping is meant to keep things
simple. If a Keyed Scene Event is Triggered, you
work it into the start of the next Scene.
However, if you’d like to start the next Scene
without knowing if the Keyed Scene was Triggered
or not you could hold off on checking for the
Trigger until you have started the new Scene. This
really only makes sense with random Triggers,
such as “Roll a 1-3 on a 1d10”, but it gives your

## Keyed Scenes Events more of a surprise element.

For instance, with our zombie apocalypse
survivor, the Trigger for a zombie attack Event
may have been worded like “After 3 Scenes
without an attack roll 1-5 on a 1d10”. As the third
Scene in a row without an attack ends, the Player
holds off on making the d10 roll for the Trigger.
They start a new Scene as normal, and then early
into the Scene they make the roll. This way they
start the Scene without knowing if the Keyed

## Scene Event will happen or not.

Delaying checking the Trigger gives you one more
thing to think about while you play, which is a
disadvantage. However, not only does it make
the Keyed Scene Event more of a surprise but
it allows you to pick the most dramatic moment
when it should happen, if it happens.

# COUNTS


## One way to formulate a Trigger is to create a

Count for it. After a certain number of things
happen the Keyed Scene Event is Triggered.
Counts can be anything, such as: how many
combats you’ve engaged in, how many Scenes
have passed without progress, how many clues
your PC has discovered, etc.
Record the Count each time the relevant
element happens to determine when the Trigger
is fulfilled.

combat in your adventure but maybe you think
this is too predictable. You can toss a randomizer
into the Trigger.
Instead of saying a combat happens after every
third Scene you could say the Trigger is “A result
of 1-3 on 1d10.” In the long run this would pan
out to happen roughly every three Scenes but you
wouldn’t know for sure when.

# KEYED SCENE FREQUENCY

It’s your choice how often a Keyed Scene Event
can be Triggered in your adventure. Maybe it’s
a one time thing, maybe it can happen over and
over. You can work frequency conditions into the
Trigger. For instance, your Trigger may state that
the Keyed Scene Event is activated when a Count
reaches 5. Once it reaches 5 the Keyed Scene Event
is Triggered and the Count is reduced to 2 and can
be increased to Trigger the Event again.
This Keyed Scene is about forcing your adventure
session to fit within a specified time frame. Maybe
you only have three hours to play and you want to
complete the adventure in that time. You can use

# KEYED SCENE NULLIFICATION

Keyed Scenes can be used as contingencies,
to make sure something necessary happens in
your adventure in case Mythic doesn’t make it
happen. For instance, your fantasy warrior may
be trying to restore a mystical spring to bring
vitality back to a kingdom but you really want to
run into some kind of magical dilemma in this
adventure too. You make a Keyed Scene Event of
“Encounter a magical dilemma.” For the Trigger,
you set “Roll 1-3 on a 1d10 every Scene after
Scene 5. This Event will only happen once.”
Let’s say in Scene 3 your warrior runs afoul of
some kind of magical dilemma through a regular
Random Event in Mythic. While exploring a cave
system near the mystic spring the PC encounters
a naturally occurring magical phenomenon where
he is attacked by a construct composed of his
worst fears.
Your Keyed Scene is no longer relevant because
what you wanted to happen as the Keyed Scene
Event, encountering a magical dilemma, has
already happened in the normal course of your
adventure. When you run up against the Trigger
for this Event you may decide that the Keyed

## Scene Event has already happened so it is done.

# GENERATING NEW


---

# KEYED SCENES

You can come up with Keyed Scenes before
your adventure as a way of making sure you get
the elements you want. You can also add new

## Keyed Scenes to your adventure as you play.

You might have a Mythic adventure about
an interesting planetary exploration where your
starship crew has found a world with ancient alien
ruins on it. As your PC explores you get an idea
that you would like your Character to encounter
a strange relic. You think that would be a cool
twist to the adventure and you want to increase
the likelihood of it happening. You make a Keyed
Scene Event of “Find a strange alien relic that has
odd, active properties.” The Trigger is “Roll 1 on
a 1d10. This Keyed Scene will only happen once.”
Now you’ve introduced the possibility of having
a Scene where you discover an active alien relic.
You set the Trigger so that it isn’t very likely to
happen in any given Scene, and may not happen at
all before the adventure is over, but it’s there as an
added possibility for any upcoming Scene.
Keyed Scenes are a way to make sure you get the
adventure you want while still being surprised
by where Mythic takes you. There are numerous
ways you can modify Mythic to meet your needs:
FATE QUESTIONS: Choosing which Questions to
ask is the simplest way to guide your adventure
without taking too heavy control of it.
CHOOSING THE EVENT FOCUS: This is nearly
direct narrative control of your adventure. When
used sparingly it can keep an adventure on track.
LISTS: The elements you place on your Lists
impact the kind of Random Events you have.
Choosing your List elements carefully is a good
way to craft the possibilities of what can happen.
THE FIRST SCENE: There are various ways you
can decide what the first Scene is, including
coming up with it entirely yourself. Having this
much control over the start of your adventure can
set the tone for everything that comes after.
THREAD PROGRESS TRACK: Put an important
Thread front and center with the Track making
sure you complete it.
CHOOSE YOUR CHAOS FLAVOR: You can
reduce the impact of the Chaos Factor on your

## Fate Questions by selecting mid-, low-, and no-

Chaos alternatives.
KEYED SCENES:  Create rules for your adventure
to make things happen that you want to happen.
PERIL POINTS: Give yourself direct and simple
narrative control to get your PC out of trouble
(you’ll see this a little later in this chapter).

# ADVENTURES

The Mythic Game Master Emulator is built to
create adventures spontaneously as you play but it
can also be used with published adventures that are
meant for group play guided by a Game Master.
Some adjustments have to be made in both how
you normally play Mythic and how you would use
a prepared adventure. I think Mythic should take
a step back from providing structure and detail
allowing the published adventure to do that. After
all, you got the published adventure because it
looked interesting. You want to preserve the details
and atmosphere of the adventure as much as
possible in solo play.
Mythic retains its role as the arbiter of
events and the answerer of Questions while the
published adventure keeps its role as the provider
of structure and detail.
Being a solo role-player doesn’t lock you out of all those wonderful prepared adventures. With a few simple adjustments you can play in those adventures
with all the surprises and GM emulation that Mythic brings.

Scaling
Most published adventures are designed
for groups but there’s a good chance you’ll be
going through it with a single Player Character.
Something needs to be done to ensure your PC
isn’t overwhelmed.

## One option is to come up with more

Characters to control until you meet the
suggested requirements of the adventure, but
this is cumbersome and might detract from the
singular experience you want to have. Another
option is to include NPCs who accompany your
Player Character, but again we get into having to
do more bookkeeping than we may want.
If you’re having a single Player Character go
through a published adventure meant for a group

## I suggest scaling the adventure down.


---

# USE A SIMPLE VALUE


## Roughly determine the power level of your

Player Character and compare that to what the
prepared adventure suggests using. Let’s say the
adventure is meant for 4-6 Characters of level 3-5
for a particularly popular fantasy RPG. Maybe
you have a Player Character ready to go who is
level 8. You figure that Character is about a 1/3rd
as powerful as the total group specifications.
That gives you a Diminisher Value of 1/3
which can now be applied to the challenges of
the prepared adventure as you encounter them to
bring them down to scale to your Player Character.
Apply the Diminisher Value to every situation
in the adventure that poses a challenge to the PC.

## For encounters and battles with NPCs use the

Diminisher Value to either reduce the number
of NPCs encountered or the relevant statistics
of the individual NPCs. For instance, if an
encounter is with 6 monsters and you are going
with a Diminisher Value of 1/3 then reduce the
encounter down to 2 since 2 is one-third of 6. Or,
instead of reducing the quantity of the encounters
you reduce their individual power instead. The

# VARIATIONS

NPCs cause 1/3rd as much damage, have a 1/3rd
as many hit points, etc.
You can reduce other hazards in the adventure
in a similar way. A pit trap causes 1/3rd as much
damage, for instance. If a danger isn’t so easily
calculated then reduce it by whatever amount feels
in line with the Diminisher Value you selected
such as lower poison potency, an easier target
number to resist, etc.
Not every value will divide evenly so you’ll have
to round your figures. Not all statistics in an RPG
lend themselves to simply being divided down.
The Diminisher Value is a benchmark to help you
make ballpark adjustments as you play. This keeps
it simple so you can make adjustments quickly.
If you encounter a monster with 70 hit points
in an adventure with a Diminisher Value of 1/3
you might decide the creature has 23 hit points.
The original monster does 2d12 damage with
a successful hit, so you scale that down to 1d8.
It can do 2 attacks per round, so you scale that
down to 1 attack per round.
Getting Started
Once you have a Diminisher Value in mind
and are ready to start the prepared adventure,
read through the introductory sections. Some
surprises may be spoiled by reading this material
but that’s okay. This approach to playing prepared
adventures solo isn’t going to be exactly like a
regular group experience, and it won’t be like a
normal solo experience either. It’s a combination
of both.
You are going to know things about the
adventure that your Player Character does not,
and you’ll have to sometimes play as though your
Character does not know what you know. (See
“Resolving Character vs. Player Knowledge” for
tips on how to handle this).
Still, read as little as possible so that you
preserve as much surprise as you can.
LISTS
As you read the introductory sections make
sure you have your Threads and Characters Lists
handy. Write down any Threads or Characters
you read about that seem important. With a
prepared adventure you are populating the Lists
with elements that are revealed to you before you
begin playing. This helps prime Mythic to set the
tone and atmosphere.

## Adventure Features

Using Mythic with prepared adventures
introduces a new List: Adventure Features.
The advice for adjusting scaling requires you to
determine the capability of your Player Character
compared to a group of Characters and to the
adventure and defining it as a simple value to
use as a Diminisher. It’s impossible to make these
adjustments perfectly so you will have to do some
rough estimating.
The important thing is to get an idea of how
your single Player Character stacks up against
the group that is expected to go through this
adventure and translate that into a Diminisher
Value. Is it 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or 1/5? Once you decide
on the value that feels right apply it to all the
challenges you encounter in the adventure, scaling
those dangers to match your Player Character.
Applying the Diminisher Value usually requires
rough estimating. Applying a diminisher of 1/3 to
a monster with 60 hit points is easy. You get 20.
What if your chosen RPG uses a value for creature
defense that isn’t a simple, divisible number like
that? In that case you would have to estimate how
to change the statistic based on the spirit of what
1/3rd might look like.
The Diminisher Value is a rule of thumb to help
you make these estimates as you play.

## Alongside Threads and Characters keep track of

Adventure Features, which is anything special or
unique that is part of this prepared adventure that
could form an encounter as you play.
A published adventure about hunting a vampire
lord includes wandering monster tables, a list of
random visions that the Player Character may
sometimes receive, and the sudden appearance
of the vampire in hit and run attacks. The

## Player puts all of these items into the Adventure

Features List as possible things that could happen

## Elements that appear in the Adventure Features

List may also appear again in the other Lists,
especially the Characters List. “Vampire Lord
attacks” may be in your Adventure Features List,
and “Vampire Lord” may be in your Characters
List, for instance.
Adventure Features is one way to link Mythic
with the tone of the prepared adventure. If you’re
playing a fantasy Character in a jungle town
looking for a guide it may be common in the
adventure for guides to seek explorers out. You
might add “Guide finds you” to the Adventure
Features List for this reason.

# GETTING CONTEXT


---

# AND CONTENT

Use the details in the prepared adventure to
help form Context, reading only as much text as
you have to when you have to.
Maybe the best way to describe running through
a prepared adventure going solo with Mythic is
approaching it as one detail at a time. You are
going to know more than your Player Character
does, that’s inevitable. However, no matter how
much you know about the adventure your PC is
still only going to encounter everything one detail
at a time.
Keeping this in mind makes the prepared
adventure manageable and also allows for
surprises.
For instance, you might be exploring a vast
dungeon that fills 125 pages in a large published
adventure. Despite all that content, your PC is
only experiencing one room at a time and one
detail in that room at a time. You are still building
your adventure element by element, just like any
other solo Mythic adventure. The only difference
here is that whereas a standard Mythic adventure
gets all its details from your expectations and
Mythic prompts, this one has a third source: the
prepared adventure text.
Approaching it one detail at a time also allows
for surprises because some of those details may
change as you play. While our intention is not to
deviate from the prepared adventure too much,
some deviation will likely still take place. This
means that all of those details are uncertain until
your Player Character encounters them and they
become part of the Context of your adventure.

## Until then they are just potential.

# ONE DETAIL AT A TIME

# VARIATIONS

The vampire lord adventure begins in a
mountain valley village your Player Character
has stumbled upon. The prepared adventure has
six pages detailing the village, with descriptions
for its various locations and encounters. There’s
also a map.
The Player uses the map to determine where
their Character goes, reading location and
encounter descriptions as they are encountered
and asking Fate Questions when necessary.
As stated earlier, this style of play of merging
Mythic with a prepared adventure requires that
you know more than your Player Character. At
the same time, you’re experiencing the adventure
one detail at a time. It’s a mixture of advance
knowledge and surprise.


---

# ENDING A SCENE

End a Scene when it feels natural, just as you
would with a regular Mythic adventure. In the
example above, the Player Character may wander
about the village for a while, learning about it
and encountering some of its citizens. There is an
important encounter with the mayor of the village.
The prepared adventure says the mayor will
beseech the Player Characters into helping fight
the vampire lord. The Player decides after this
encounter is a good spot to end the Scene.
Finding the right place to end a Scene while
playing through a prepared adventure may not
feel right at first. In a standard Mythic game a
Scene will play itself out. You’re either looking for
the main focus of the Scene to conclude or one of
the other end of Scene strategies chosen from the
“Scenes” chapter. You have a tactic for when to
end a Scene.
With a prepared adventure, you may be moving
from one location and encounter in the text
to another. Each of those encounters may feel
distinct, causing you to wonder if this should be
considered a Scene.

# STARTING A NEW SCENE

Start a new Scene like you normally would
with Mythic by coming up with an Expected
Scene idea. You can base this on what you know
of the adventure and what happened in the
previous Scene.
The Expected Scene is likely going to be one of
two things:
 » Picking up from the activity of the previous
Scene.
 » Continuing on to something new.
This adventure included an interesting Scene where the Player Character bet on a boxing match between two droids. In this section of the prepared
adventure the boxing match is a way for the PC to meet the green droid after the bout. Watching the boxing match was an opportunity to see what
this potential new ally could do. The Player decides that the end of the fight is a good place to end the Scene, with the next Scene being about
meeting the droid afterward.

# VARIATIONS

For instance, in the earlier example about the
vampire hunt adventure the Player ended the
Scene after encountering the mayor. Based on
that, the idea for the next Expected Scene could
be “Meet with the Mayor at her office to find out
what’s going on.”
On the other hand, you may have no idea
what to expect next from the adventure. In that
case the Expected Scene could be as simple as
“Continue on.” For instance, in the example about
the jungle temple adventure, the Player ended the
Scene after a fight in the hall. The Player has no
idea what’s coming next so the Expected Scene is
simply, “Continue down the hall.”


---

# TESTING THE SCENE

We want to stick as much as possible to
the prepared adventure, Mythic is not here to
overtake the adventure but to tweak it as we go.
Mythic is more of a co-GM with the prepared
adventure having priority.

## With that in mind we won’t be using Altered or

Interrupt Scenes when playing through a prepared
adventure. Instead test the Expected Scene to see
if a Random Event happens.
If you roll within the Chaos Factor when
testing the Expected Scene generate a Random
Event. Since your Lists are being filled with
Threads and Characters your Player Character
has encountered and that were added at the start
the Random Event will have the flavor of the
prepared adventure.
This Random Event is different than one you
would generate for an Interrupt Scene. With an
Interrupt, the Random Event becomes the central
focus of the Scene, replacing the Expected Scene.
Here we’re keeping the Expected Scene and
adding the Random Event to it as extra content.
 The Random Event won’t dramatically change
the course of the adventure like an Interrupt
could, it’s more like when a Game Master has
a good idea in the middle of an adventure and
decides to spring it on the Player Characters.
You can decide to have the Random Event
take place at the beginning of the Scene or a little
further in if it seems more appropriate.
Our fantasy warrior exploring the vampire’s
castle has found the stairs to the catacombs. The

## Player decided to end the Scene there, so the next

Expected Scene became “Descend the stairs into
the catacomb.”
When testing this Expected Scene the Player rolls
within the Chaos Factor. In normal Mythic play
this would call for an Altered or Interrupt Scene
but the Player instead makes it a Random Event
for the Expected Scene.
The Player’s end of Scene strategy is “Interest”
in a solo Mythic adventure through a prepared
module about the exploration of an ancient
jungle temple.
A Scene starts with the Player Character entering
the underground temple. The PC moves along
the main hall, finding an inscription in the wall.
They read it, gaining some clues about what lies
ahead, and move on. They enter a room full of
vine strewn statues. Inside the room, within a
secret compartment at the base of a statue, they
find a key. Moving on from the room and back
into the hall, the PC continues forward until they
have a surprise encounter with a wandering
monster. This results in a brief battle where the
PC dispatches the creature.
The Player decides to end the Scene here. All
of those events were part of one Scene, but it
didn’t feel right to end the Scene until the battle
encounter. The previous encounters, such as
finding the inscription on the wall and locating
the hidden key, just didn’t strike the Player as
interesting enough to be the end of the Scene.
However, the fight was the first bit of real action
in the adventure. That, coupled with the previous
events, felt like a good place to end the Scene.

# ENDING WITH ACTION

162162

# VARIATIONS


### Rolling on the Focus and Meaning Tables,

the Player gets PC Negative, and “Decrease”
and “Freedom”. The Player decides this means
that winds that the PC has been experiencing
throughout the castle are much stronger in the
stairwell, making it difficult to maintain his
torch and visibility. He’s going to have to proceed
more carefully in the catacombs since he can’t see
as well in the flickering light.
If the Player had instead rolled NPC Action
and “Communicate” and “Danger”, and if the

## NPC rolled on the Characters List had been

Brookfield, a human servant of the vampire, the
Player may have interpreted it this way: as the PC
descends into the catacombs and explores they
come across Brookfield (an NPC already defined
in the prepared adventure as a possible wandering
encounter), who will try to talk the PC into
fleeing from the castle.
Both of these Random Events added a surprise
without breaking the prepared adventure.

## Encounters And Locations

Prepared adventures provide a collection of
places and encounters for Player Characters to
interact with. Just like with the beginning of the
adventure, only read as much of each encounter
as you have to when the encounter begins. Read
to understand what the PC is experiencing, then
decide what they do. After this, read further
to understand what consequences the Player
Character’s actions may have.
There will likely be some spoilers with this
approach, but that’s okay. We are separating
Player knowledge from Character knowledge as
much as we can, and the goal is to experience the
flavor of the adventure even if that means getting
clued in on some of the surprises.
As our Player Character enters the catacombs
and begins to explore, they come across a dusty
room with several coffins in it. The Player stops
reading the prepared adventure at this point and
decides his Character is going to enter the room
and carefully open the coffins. After deciding this
the Player reads on and discovers that one coffin
has a wight in it that will attack if disturbed.
There is also a pressure plate on the floor that
if stepped on will alert the wight who will then
spring out of the coffin and attack.
The prepared adventure provides rules for how
to decide if the Player Character steps on the
pressure plate so the Player follows through to
see if his Character did. The Player already
The approach outlined here for playing in
prepared adventures using Mythic tries to take
a soft approach, altering as little about the
adventure as possible. However, Mythic will
introduce little, detailed changes as you play.
Fate Questions might alter how an encounter is
supposed to take place, Random Events during
a Scene may introduce new elements or shift
existing elements around, and testing the Scene
and generating a Random Event introduces even
more changes.
Each individual change is fairly small. If it requires
you to change the prepared adventure that
alteration will probably be easy to do. The further
you go into the adventure, the more these
changes add up. This leads to an experience
that is true to how the author of the adventure
intended, but with narrative elements that you
could not predict even if you had read the entire
adventure cover to cover.
When a change contradicts what’s written in
the adventure, give priority to the change. The
contents of the prepared adventure are all
potential details until they happen in the game,
which means any of them can be changed if the
unfolding adventure demands it. Once something
happens in the adventure, whether it’s as written
or is the result of a Mythic prompt, then it
becomes solid Context.

knows the Character is opening both coffins so an
encounter with the wight is inevitable.
If at any point in the process of adjudicating
an encounter you aren’t sure what should happen
you can always pose it as a Fate Question. For
instance, maybe the pressure plate is triggered
if you walk to one of the coffins first. Since the
Player isn’t sure which coffin the PC approached
first they might pose it as a Fate Question, “Did
he step on the plate?”
Encounters in a prepared adventure are
resolved liked this with a combination of
reading as much as you have to, deciding what
to do, reading more, then navigating how it all
unfolds using your judgement and Mythic to
guide you.
Random Events

## When rolling for Random Events use the


### Prepared Adventure Focus Table instead of the

regular Event Focus Table. This version removes
the entries for Remote Event, New NPC, Move
Toward A Thread, Move Away From A Thread,
Close A Thread, and Ambiguous Event. You don’t
need Mythic to produce these events for you since
the prepared adventure already does it.
What remains is NPC Action, NPC
Negative, NPC Positive, PC Negative, PC
Positive, and Current Context. These are all
results that use elements from the prepared
adventure, allowing you to present those
elements in Random Events that don’t break the
overall adventure as presented.

### There is one more result possible on that table:

Adventure Feature, which was discussed earlier.
Adventure Features are elements that are unique
to the prepared adventure.

## If you roll Adventure Feature as a Random


## Event you may not have to roll on the Event


### Meaning Tables for further clarification if it’s

not necessary. For instance, maybe the prepared
adventure is about modern espionage where the
Player Character is a spy who has been poisoned
and must work to find the antidote before she
dies. The prepared adventure may include a
special mechanic to determine the advancement
of the poison where the Gamemaster determines
after some time that the PC gets worse along a
pre-determined scale.
This could be represented as an element in
the Adventure Features List, “Poison gets worse.”
Getting that result for a Random Event may
not require any rolls on the Meaning Tables
for clarification because it’s a straightforward
mechanic to track the poison.
If the Adventure Feature rolled was
“Wandering monster”, requiring you to roll on a
wandering monster table, you may still want to
roll on the Meaning Tables to get a clue as to how
the monster approaches or what they do.

## Given the wide variety of possibilities with

Adventure Features, use your judgement in how
one translates into a Random Event.

Final Thoughts
The system presented here for playing any
prepared adventure solo makes Mythic take a step
back to allow the prepared adventure to shine with
its content and creativity. It replaces some of the
surprises the prepared adventure would normally
produce for surprises that Mythic produces.
This results in a unique experience each time the
prepared adventure is played, a different way to
enjoy both Mythic and published adventures.

### Using the Prepared Adventure Event Focus Table helps to include content that is otherwise presented by a Game Master running the adventure.

This comes in handy for elements that aren’t part of described locations or encounters. For instance, maybe you’re playing through a future-tech
adventure where scavenging old mecha facilities has a random chance of turning up usable battle armor. This could be represented on your
Adventure Feature List as “Find useful tech.”

# CAMPAIGNS

Growing a solo adventure into a full fledged
campaign is a magical experience. From what
likely started as humble beginnings with a Player
Character and a few ideas has grown into a full
dynamic world with ever-growing lore.
However, an ongoing series of adventures poses
unique challenges the further you get.
Ragnor the Rogue’s life was simple when you
started playing. Steal a gem for a wealthy client
and stay out of the city jail. Eight adventures
later Ragnor is embroiled in a plot to overthrow
the king, fighting against the return of a long
forgotten evil god, and dealing with a gallery
of personal villains and friends so large you’ve
forgotten who some of them are.
Threads and Characters Lists bursting at
the seams is probably the most obvious and
immediate problem with adventure campaigns
that are complicated because they’ve gone on for
so long.

## List Editing With I Dunno Rule

The end of each Scene is the time to add
and remove elements from your Characters and
Threads Lists. The simplest way to manage
a List that’s thick with elements is to remove
the Characters and Threads that are no longer
relevant to your adventure.
However, editing your Lists can get tougher the
more complex your adventure gets.
Maybe you want your adventure to have a lot
going on. You might add all kinds of NPCs and
Threads to your Lists to include all the content you
can. You never know when that taxi driver may
turn out to be a secret enemy or that woman you
bumped into at the nightclub might show up as a
vampire clinging to the wall of your apartment.
Pruning your Lists is still a good tactic with
complicated adventures but using the “I Dunno

## Rule” can help simplify the process.

The “I Dunno Rule” recognizes that Mythic
provides lots of prompts to spur your imagination
but its randomness also means that sometimes it
will give prompts that don’t work for you. If you
can’t interpret a Mythic prompt quickly, whether
it’s an answer to a Fate Question or a Random
Event result, then consider saying “I don’t know”
drop it and move on.
Difficult to interpret Random Events can
become an issue in a complicated adventure
campaign, especially one with a fully loaded
You may like to place lots of NPCs on your Characters List, even if
they don’t seem important at first. This can create a full List fast
leading to a need to prune.

Characters List. Maybe your Player Character
started in the Kingdom of Halvand, then spent
time at the Court Of King Deneral, engaged in
dungeon delving in the Tomb Of Antherat, and
is now on an adventure exploring the Chittering
Woods.
That’s a lot of ground your Player Character has
covered. Your Characters List would have people
you met from Halvand in it, probably the first
NPCs you encountered. A few adventures later
things got more interesting as you rubbed elbows
with royalty, now you have a prince, a king, and a
bunch of royal family members on the List. The
trip through the dungeon really expanded the List,
adding monsters and other oddities. Finally, now
that you’re in the Chittering Woods you made
contact with a community of forest fairies which
you’ve added to the Characters List.

## So what does this have to do with the “I

Dunno Rule”? It’s this: if you are hesitant to cut
down your List because every element on it, no
matter how remote it may seem now, feels like it
still has potential you can let the “I Dunno Rule”
be the arbiter on whether an element stays or goes.
Instead of deciding at the end of a Scene if an
element should be cut from the List wait until
you are required to roll on the List. If you roll
a List element that causes you to invoke the “I
Dunno Rule” then that’s a sign that the element
should be cut.
This creates a rule around when to remove
elements from a List instead of you deciding
when they are no longer relevant. Now it’s Mythic
deciding when they are no longer relevant. Those
elements get to stay on their List as long as they
want, but as soon as they get called upon and you
have no idea what to do with them then they get
crossed out.

## Adventure Cohesion

Maybe your adventure has gone on so long that
there are lots of Threads going on. There could be
many crucial NPCs whose actions are important
to your adventure. These Threads and Characters
elements should all combine to craft the narrative
of your game.
I’m calling this adventure “cohesion” because
your ongoing campaign should feel like a
unified whole, all the parts working together. A
complicated adventure or series of adventures may
have so many active elements that it can start to
feel fractured, losing cohesion to the point where
you aren’t sure what is going on or where the
narrative is heading.
Here are some ideas to keep your adventure all
nicely glued together.

# START FRESH

Usually a Mythic Player ends an adventure
when a main Thread has been resolved. You
wrap up the adventure and then consider starting
a new one, bringing over the Threads and
Characters you want if you plan to build on the
previous adventure.
While you can end an adventure when you feel
it’s reached a culminating moment you can also
end it whenever you want. It could be when you
are right in the middle of a big battle, or dealing
with a mystery, or when you haven’t solved any
Threads at all.
Ending an adventure and starting over with
a new one is one way to help regain a sense of
cohesion to a complicated campaign.
Think about the first Scene in a Mythic
adventure. That opening Scene is unique. It
isn’t influenced by the Chaos Factor. While
it can be constructed like an Interrupt with a

## Random Event it doesn’t have to be. The first

Scene can be anything you want it to be. You
have more narrative and creative control over
the first Scene than you do any other Scene in
an adventure.
So let’s use that to refocus an adventure that
has gotten lost.
Ragnor the Rogue’s time in the Chittering Woods
has gotten interesting. After befriending the
fairies by name-dropping Prince Toymin, Ragnor
has undertaken to help the fairy community
reclaim a long lost magical crown taken by a
group of criminal outcasts.
In the process of fulfilling this quest Ragnor
encounters the outcasts, and finds them to be a
peaceful group who are on the run from their
brethren. It turns out that Prince Toymin
didn’t so much declare a portion of the forest to
be protected as he declared war on a segment
of fairy society that were unpopular with the
majority. When fleeing their homes the outcast
leader took the crown with him to use its power
to help his people survive.
Now Ragnor’s Player is conflicted about
where to go with this adventure. Does Ragnor
make good on his offer to help the forest fairies?
Does he switch sides, throwing off the previous
course of this adventure toward a new direction?
What about Ragnor’s association with the royal
family? Is he about to burn an important bridge
for himself?

## The adventure has just gotten complicated.

The Player could continue the adventure,
creating Expected Scenes and going from there
to see what happens. Or they can consider the
adventure is over and start a new one. The Player
can review and edit the Lists and decide what the
starting Scene should be that would help refocus
the adventure narrative.
The Player decides to refocus the adventure by
ending it and starting a new one. To clean up
the campaign narrative, the Player decides that
the new adventure takes place a month later
after Ragnor switched sides to help the outcasts.
He is now camping with them in the forest,
helping them evade patrols searching for them.
Earlier, editing Lists was discussed to keep them
focused and under control. That advice goes
along very well with starting over.
Ending an adventure and continuing with a
new one already involves List pruning. If one
adventure is a continuation of the previous you
are going to pull over Threads and NPCs, making
choices about what to keep and what to drop.
If you find yourself having to do an extensive edit
of a List you may want to take this as a sign that
it’s time to end the adventure and start a new
one. You can use this as an opportunity to review
your ongoing adventure, helping to ensure it
makes sense and stays manageable.

# MULTIPLE LISTS

Multiple Lists are a good way to keep a
complicated adventure organized and help
maintain cohesion. It could work like this:
you have your Lists for an ongoing adventure
that has gotten quite complicated with various
communities of NPCs and lots of Player
Character goals. The geography of your adventure
takes place in several separate areas that your PC
commonly travels through. To make it even more
complicated you’ve decided to add a second PC
to the adventure that has nothing to do with your
other Player Character, you just thought it would
be interesting.
By using multiple Lists your Lists may look
something like this:
 » A Threads List for your first PC.
 » A Threads List for your second PC.
 » A Characters List for your first PC in the
region they primarily roam.
 » Another Characters List for your first PC
for a distant region they sometimes visit.
 » A Characters List for your second PC.

## That’s a total of five Lists for a single adventure.

Each List has a different focus depending on
which PC we are dealing with or which geographic
region the Character is in at the time.
Maintaining multiple Lists is a way to
categorize the elements of a complicated
adventure into meaningful chunks. This makes it
more likely that you will get results for Random
Events and Interrupts that make sense with where
your narrative is physically currently at, helping to
maintain adventure cohesion.


---

# WHAT TO PUT ON A LIST

If you decide to create multiple Lists decide
what the new List and the old List are for. Maybe
your fantasy Character spends most of their
time near a city but they are also adventuring in
a nearby dungeon. The dungeon is an ongoing
element in your adventures with the Character
occasionally returning to it to explore further.
This has created a situation where you
essentially have two adventures going on at the
same time: what goes on in the city and what
happens in the dungeon.
You might decide to break your Lists into ones
that pertain to the city and the dungeon. You pull
all the dungeon related NPCs off the original List
and place them on the new dungeon Characters
List. There may be a few Threads that are
dungeon related so you make a separate dungeon
Threads List. You use the city Lists when the
adventure takes place in the city and the dungeon

## Lists when your PC is exploring there.

The Lists don’t have to be mutually exclusive,
you can have the same elements on both Lists.
For instance, maybe the Player has a Thread of
“Find the Eye of Yeehon,” a mystical artifact that
is fabled to be hidden in the dungeon. This is why
your Character spends so much time adventuring
in there. However, the Thread also applies to the
city. There is plenty of lore to be learned about the
Eye that can be gleaned from experts in town. It
makes sense to have that Thread be on both Lists.

## When playing with multiple Lists, when to use one

List or another is up to you. If the circumstances
of your adventure seem to indicate a particular
List then use it.
When you separate a List into multiple Lists
they don’t have to be broken down just by
geography. Anything that helps divide List
elements can be used. While geographic
locations are easy to identify you could also
use themes if your adventure has various tones
(action, personal drama, etc.), areas of Player
Character interest, or just about anything that
pertains to your adventure.
When you decide that a particular List is active
for a Scene, that is the List you will edit during the
end of Scene Bookkeeping.

# WHICH LIST TO USE

168168 169169

# VARIATIONS

# PERIL POINTS


## The adventuring life is perilous, and most


## Player Characters need a helping hand sometimes.

In social, guided role-play that helping hand
comes from the Game Master. Often unknown
to the Players the GM may quietly divert your PC
from certain doom to keep the adventure going.
You can represent this saving hand in solo
role-playing using Peril Points. A Peril Point can
be spent at any time to change the narrative and
save your Player Character when your adventure is
about to end and you don’t want it to.
Your Player Character is a young mage in
a game of modern, urban magic. They are
currently climbing up the side of a building at
night to try and stop a warlock from casting a
ritual that would take over the minds of everyone
in the city.
Your PC has a companion helping, a former
assistant to the warlock who now wants to help
you stop him. He has reached the roof first
when a Random Event indicates he turns on
your Character.
The Player asks the Fate Question, “Does he cut
the rope?” and Mythic says Yes.
The Player has a problem now. The PC is thirty
floors above a city street, hanging from a rope
that is being cut. They have no way to avert
certain death from the fall.
The Player is using Peril Points with this game
and has 2 Points left in the pool. This is a good
time to spend one.
The Player interprets it this way: The rope is cut
and the Player Character falls about fifteen feet
before hitting the railing of a balcony. They grab
on to the railing desperately and are able to haul
themselves to the balcony.

## While Supplies Last

Decide before you play how many Peril Points
your Player Character gets. This value is up to
you, the more Points the more chances you have
to change an outcome. A limited pool helps
maintain narrative tension since Peril Points
should only be used when necessary. A supply of 2

## Peril Points is a good default.

When you use a Peril Point you can change the
narrative to prevent the adventure from ending.
For instance, if a monster just rolled the killing
blow for your Player Character you spend a Peril
Point and suddenly the bridge you’re standing on
breaks sending you tumbling to the river below
out of harm’s way instead.
Peril Points is a blunt instrument to save an
adventure from an early end. There are other
ways to avert certain doom, such as asking
narrative building Fate Questions. (See “Narrative

## Killing Questions” on page 83).

You can also build your Player Character’s survival
into the Context of your adventure. For instance,
you can decide ahead of time that your PC cannot
die. That’s part of the Context of your adventure.
If something happens that would result in their
death, it gets changed to something else.
Mythic presents multiple ways to sustain an
adventure because there are a multitude of
solo play styles out there. If you are a narrative
style Player who loves the story and is okay with
manipulating it when you have to, then focusing
on asking narrative building Questions and using

## Context to save your PC may be to your liking.

If you’re more of a simulationist Player, where you
love the excitement of knowing your choices can
lead to success or failure then saving yourself
with Context may feel too artificial. In this case, a
limited number of Peril Points could be used as an
emergency, but even those are in short supply.

# AND THE STORY GOES ON

# VARIATIONS

Whether or not Peril Points get replenished is
also up to you. If you want Peril Points to help
make each game session more survivable, you may
reset them to their maximum supply at the start
of each adventure session. If, instead, you want to
use Peril Points to help get your PC started you
may give them a fixed number of Peril Points.

## Once those are gone they are forever gone.

# CRAFTER WITH

# MYTHIC

When The Adventure Crafter published in
2018 it offered a new way to generate random
adventures. I viewed it as an alternate version of
the Mythic Game Master Emulator, coming at the
same goal from another point of view.

## The Adventure Crafter borrows many familiar

Mythic concepts, like Lists and breaking an
adventure down into structural components
(Turning Points instead of Mythic’s Scenes).
It also introduces new concepts and its own
approach for generating content. The two
systems work well together, and The Adventure
Crafter offers three pages of explanation on how
to merge them.
This section updates those rules while
making some changes and adding new concepts
to hopefully make the Mythic Game Master
Emulator and The Adventure Crafter  play together
as nicely as possible.
The First Scene
Using The Adventure Crafter to generate the
opening Scene of a Mythic adventure is a natural.
It can create a detailed introduction to your
adventure that includes Plotlines (The Adventure

## Crafter’s term for Threads) and NPCs.


## Generating a single Turning Point with The

Adventure Crafter should be enough to give you
a detailed outline of a Scene. However, for the
First Scene, consider generating more than one

## Turning Point if you want a more detailed Scene.

Creating two or three Turning Points can give
you a wealth of detail for your First Scene and
additional Plotlines and Characters to get you
started. You can think of this as analogous to a
published adventure module giving you a detailed
start to an adventure, with a history of events and
the circumstances that have brought your Player
Character into it.
The Adventure
Crafter is a book
in the Crafter

## Series from Word

Mill Games.
It’s a system
for randomly
generating a
narrative structure,
using common
fictional tropes
to assemble a
story outline. This
adventure outline can be used as inspiration for
making a fully fleshed out adventure scenario,
as an adventure seed generator for new
adventures, a background or history creator, or
just about anything where you want to randomly
create a layered narrative.
The Adventure Crafter pairs nicely with Mythic in a
number of ways, from helping to make starting

## Scenes to acting as a replacement for how


## Interrupt Scenes are generated.


---

# THE ADVENTURE CRAFTER

170170 171171


---

# VARIATIONS


## Altered and Interrupt Scenes


## The Adventure Crafter suggests using Turning


## Points to generate both Altered and Interrupt

Scenes. I am changing this advice to suggest only
using The Adventure Crafter to generate Interrupt
Scenes. To keep your adventure moving swiftly

## Altered Scenes should follow Mythic’s rules.


## You can generate an Interrupt using The

Adventure Crafter  by creating a Turning Point
to replace the Random Event that Mythic
normally uses.
Mythic Interrupt Scenes often change the
direction of an adventure, sometimes in dramatic
ways. Using Turning Points as Interrupts increases
the chances of making big changes in the adventure
because more elements can come into play.
Lists

## I suggest using Mythic Game Master Emulator


## Second Edition List rules instead of Adventure

Crafter Lists when combining the two systems
(this is a change from the advice given in Mythic
Magazine #5, to account for differences in Second
Edition rules). Adventure Crafter Plotlines and

## Mythic Threads are the same thing, so whenever

The Adventure Crafter refers to Plotlines consider it
the same as Threads.
Using Mythic Adventure List Sheets, Threads
and NPCs are added to your Lists when they are

## Invoked by an Adventure Crafter Turning Point.


## You should add them to your List while Plot

Points are generated, instead of doing it after a
Scene in Bookkeeping, so later Plot Points in the
same Turning Point have a chance to Invoke them.

## Edit your Lists as normal during end of Scene

Bookkeeping. Whether a Thread or NPC is part
of a Turning Point and was added to a List at
the beginning of the Scene, or was added later
because it appeared while playing out the Scene,
it still just gets added once to its List for the
Scene as normal.
Threads and NPCs are removed at your
discretion during Scene Bookkeeping as you
would in a typical Mythic Adventure.
In a gritty sci-fi adventure game the Player just
generated an Interrupt Scene. They are playing
Mythic with The Adventure Crafter, so they use
a Turning Point to define this Interrupt.

## Rolling for their Plot Points using Adventure

Crafter rules, one of the Plot Points generated
is “A Character Is Incapacitated”. The Player
determines that this Plot Point applies to a new
NPC being generated. The Player comes up with
“Zango Finley”, an aquatic mutant. The Player
writes this new NPC onto the Characters List and
continues to generate the rest of the Plot Points.
It turns out Zango is incapacitated because he
has been trapped in a watery cage by a group
of raiders who have been sacking villages up
and down the coast. They are using a machine
to siphon Zango’s powers and use the energy to
charge up their weapons.
The Scene proceeds with the Player Character
and her companions catching sight of the raiders’
caravan. Noticing the captive, they sneak
toward the group and are able to successfully
rescue Zango. The mission doesn’t go smoothly,

## Making a full Turning Point with The Adventure

Crafter isn’t as fast as generating a Random Event
in Mythic. A Turning Point is composed of 5 Plot
Points, and each Plot Point may involve Plotlines
and Characters. All of this has to be interpreted
into something meaningful.
If creating full Turning Points for Interrupt Scenes
is slowing your game down too much, consider
using fewer Plot Points. If 5 is too many, try 4 or
3.  Even 1 or 2 Plot Points is enough to inspire a
meaningful Scene.

however, with a fight breaking out between the

to use his energy powers to help them all escape.
During end of Scene Bookkeeping the Player
doesn’t add Zango to the Characters List again
because they already did at the beginning of the

## Scene while generating the Turning Point.


---

# ROLLING ON A LIST

Rolling on Lists is handled differently when
a Plot Point Invokes a Thread or Character than
when a Mythic Random Event calls for rolling on
a List.
Normally in Mythic when a Random Event
requires a trip to a List, such as when you roll an
Event Focus of NPC Action, you check to see how
much of your List is filled then roll up to two dice
to determine which part of the List to roll on and
then what element in that part is selected.
When rolling on a List for a Plot Point, however,
roll on the full List regardless of the number
of elements in it. Roll 2d10 with the first d10
determining which section of the List to refer to
and the second d10 selecting a line in that section.
This means it’s far more likely to roll a blank
line when Invoking a Character or Thread
with a Plot Point than it is when rolling for a
Random Event. While Mythic Random Events
are meant to throw surprises at you, often using
an existing element in your adventure in a new
way, Adventure Crafter Turning Points are meant
to add new story twists to your adventure. These
Turning Points may have multiple elements to
interpret, with Plot Points framed as drama
tropes. With all this potential additional meaning
to make an interpretation out of you also get
additional control of the Lists to help make those
interpretations smoother.
    CHOOSE TO ...

## When rolling an empty line for a Mythic

Random Event you have the option to Choose. This
choice is either to select an element from the List
that you think fits the situation best or to roll again.
When rolling an empty line for an Invoked
element for a Plot Point, however, you have an
additional choice: Add a Thread or Character.
Choosing to add a Thread or a Character is the
same as when using The Adventure Crafter  alone
172172 173173


---

# VARIATIONS

and you roll an empty line on a List that says
“New Plotline” or “New Character”.
Threads in a Mythic adventure usually occur
organically as you play. You, the Player, decide
when you want something to be a new Player
Character objective.
However, since Turning Points often describe
a narrative event with multiple moving parts this
is a good opportunity to inject a new Thread into
your adventure.
The same applies to Characters. Maybe you
rolled up a Plot Point where it makes sense that a
new Character is now involved in the adventure.
If it seems appropriate then choose this to be a
new Character. Follow the regular Adventure
Crafter rules for creating a new NPC, generating
their Trait, Identity, and Descriptors.


---

# WHAT GOES ON THE


---

# CHARACTERS LIST


## In normal Adventure Crafter rules every


## Character goes on the Characters List, both Player


## Characters and Non-Player Characters.

When combining the two systems, however,
only place Non-Player Characters on the List as
you normally would in a Mythic adventure.

## If you Invoke a Character and roll on the

List and get a blank line, you have the option to

## Choose a Character from the List for this Plot

Point. Even though your Player Character isn’t on
the List, you can still Choose them. This allows
you to include your Player Character in Plot

## Points when it makes the most sense to do so.

The Player’s science fiction adventure has been
going well, with Zango turning out to be an
important addition to the Player Character’s
team. They’ve learned that the warlord
leading the raiders was a deposed ruler from a
neighboring territory. He’s been ransacking the
countryside looking for an ancient artifact of
great power.

## The Player just wrapped up a Scene where the

Player Character has been posing as a cook in
the raider’s camp to learn more about the leader
and his plans. The next Expected Scene was the
PC sneaking out of the camp to report back to
her friends, but the Player generated at Interrupt
Scene instead.

## Making a Turning Point to define the

Interruption, one of the Plot Points is “The
Observer”. This Plot Point is about one
Character secretly observing another Character
doing something. The Player needs to Invoke two
Characters to see who is spying on whom. The
first roll on the Characters List gets “Raiders”.
The second roll gets a blank line. The Player
decides that what makes the most sense is that
this second Character is their Player Character,
If you use The
Adventure Crafter Deck
instead of the book
you can combine
it with Mythic
by making a few
changes to the rules
presented here.
Instead of rolling on
a List for an Invoked
Thread or Character
you can draw a
card as normal and
use the number on the card next to Plotlines or
Characters. This will tell you which line on the List
to select. The Adventure Lists are numbered 1 to
25 on the right.
If you get a blank line instead of choosing whether
to select an element on the List or to have a
new Thread or Character be created, you can let
the deck decide by going with the result printed
below “Plotlines” or “Characters”.

observing something as they are on their way out

The Player interprets all of this to mean that
while the Player Character is sneaking away,
they come across a group of raiders preparing a

the next town in their way. The PC hurries
out of the camp quickly. They need to warn the

Let’s do one more Big Example! As in the

text to describe the role-played story and regular
text to explain what the Player is doing.
For this example,
the Player is using
Mythic with their

The game features
colorful superhero
action set in a
universe much like
our own, except
that super powers,
advanced science, and
alien incursions are an
every day norm.

## The Player has a Character ready to go:

Rapid Red, a speedster hero who can move
supersonically fast. This is the Player’s first
adventure using this hero, so there is no history
going in. The Player has a blank copy of the

## Adventure Journal and Adventure Lists.

To generate the first Scene the Player decides to
create a Random Event. Rolling on the Random

### Event Focus Table they get “New NPC”. To get

some idea what this Character is doing the Player
rolls on the Actions Meaning Tables and gets
“Triumph” and “Cooperation”.
The Player interprets the Meaning words as a
group of superheroes who are tackling a problem.
Since this Event is about establishing a new NPC,
the Player decides it means this group is a team.
The Player wants to know what kind of
problem the team is taking on. Whatever it is, it’s
probably what attracts Rapid Red as well, where
he runs into the team.

## The Player considers framing this as a Fate

problem is they choose to go directly to a Meaning

## This example runs through a few Scenes of a

Player starting a new adventure. Various Mythic
rules are used in the example, including asking
Fate Questions and Discovering Meaning by
getting details from Meaning Tables.
One thing to keep in mind when reading this
playthrough are the times the Player chooses to
get a prompt from Mythic, and when they choose
not to. Everyone is going to play their solo games
differently, so there is no rule dictating when
you must ask a Question or get a prompt for a
detail. The decision is yours for when you want
to rely on your expectations, creating details
through improvisation, and when to stop and get
a prompt from Mythic.

## The Player also makes use of the Elements


### Meaning Tables for some details. Once again,

choosing an Elements Table, and which Table you
choose, is up to you. There are multiple tables
that can serve the same purpose, including just
using the core Actions and Descriptions Tables.
Personal preference and gut feeling is your friend
here. There is no wrong choice, especially if you

Rapid Red is Rick Burgundy, a reporter for
the internet news site The Blurb. He’s working
at their downtown offices when news of the
disturbances start getting called in. No one needs
to be informed, however, as just looking out their
high rise windows shows the chaos below.
Since Rapid works downtown the Player
wondered if he might be close enough to the
disturbances to see them. The Player asks a Fate
Question, “Can he see what’s going on?” The Player
gives this Odds of Likely, and Mythic says Yes.

## To interpret what the PC actually sees, the


## Player considers Discovering Meaning again.

However, they already know that something
strange is going on and it involves rifts in reality
and another dimension leaking into our world.
The Player decides to run with what they expect
this to look like rather than get another prompt.
Looking out the window, Rick can see weird
strands of blue energy snaking between buildings.
Everything the strands touch wavers and warps,
as if reality itself were uncertain what it should
be. Sirens, car horns, and people screaming can
be heard.
It’s time for Rick to leap into action and help
save people! The Player’s expectation is that Rick
has exited work many times before in order to
act as Rapid Red, so there is no need to ask a

## Question to see if he has any trouble getting away.

The Player considers if this should be the end
of the first Scene. However, it doesn’t feel quite
complete yet without Rapid getting to the site of
the disturbance first.
Making a few quick excuses at the office, Rapid
zooms down the stairwell, changing into his
superhero uniform before he reaches the street.
Moving in the blink of an eye he runs to the
center of the ruckus.
When setting up this first Scene the Player had
established that Rapid would encounter a new
NPC, a team dealing with the problem. Now
that the problem has been determined, this seems
like a logical time to encounter the team. This is
a well grounded expectation so the Player doesn’t
feel a need to ask a Fate Question for it.
However, the Player does ask: “Does Rapid
recognize the team helping people?” Giving
this Odds of Likely, Mythic comes back with
Exceptional Yes.
The Player interprets this to mean that not
only does Rapid recognize them but they are a
famous group of superheros.
The Player considers making up a name for
the team but figures it would be more fun to roll
up a random name. Using the Names Elements

### Table they roll “Fah” and “Ow”. Needing more

inspiration the Player keeps rolling and gets “N”
and “R”. This kind of sounds like “Founder”, so the

## Player goes with a team name of “The Founders”.

Even though this is this Player’s first
adventure with this Character, and this is the
first Scene, decisions the Player is making are
already building Context for the adventure.
Rapid Red works in a downtown office
building. He is experienced with leaving
work unnoticed when hero duty calls.
These are small but important details. Every
detail created in an adventure, whether it’s
derived from a Fate Question, a Random

### Event, a Meaning Table, or your own

expectations, all becomes part of the Context
which influences later expectations. It all
builds together creating a layered, detailed,
and consistent adventure.

# THE BIG EXAMPLE

Arriving in the midst of downtown, Rapid sees
the arcing blue energy up close tearing apart
buildings and roads. However, people are
already being rescued by a group of superheroes:
the world famous Founders.
Rapid gets in on the action and uses his super
speed to help rescue people threatened by the
anomaly. The Player wants a situation for their
PC to get involved. There’s no need to ask a Fate
Question about this, it’s already been established
that there is general mayhem going on. There is,
undoubtedly, plenty of opportunities for Rapid
to help.
The Player decides to Discover Meaning to
help determine what emergency Rapid can help
with. Rolling on the Actions Meaning Tables,
the Player gets “Release” and “Vehicle”. The
Player interprets this to mean that a car has
been knocked to the edge of a freeway overpass
when the road got warped by the wild energies.
Someone is trapped in the car, which teeters on
the brink of plummeting to the concrete below.
Rapid moves quickly, in a blur zooming along
the road to the overpass.
“Does the car start to fall before Rapid
gets there?” The Player gives this Odds
of Nearly Impossible considering his
fantastic speed and Mythic says No.
Rapid arrives at the car, pulls the driver
out of it, and deposits them safely a block away
before they are even aware of what is going on.
The Player doesn’t want to role-play every
save in this crisis, just the one to set some flavor
for the Scene. They wonder though if the rip
in reality closes up, or if this is going to be an
ongoing situation. The Player asks “Does
the rift close?” This seems Very Likely to
the Player. With the Chaos Factor still at its
starting value of 5, they roll on the Fate Chart
getting a 22. This is a Yes, but also a Random
Event since double digits were
rolled and the single digit value is less than or
equal to the Chaos Factor.

## The Player rolls 91 on the Random Event


### Focus Table, “Current Context”. Rolling on

the Actions Meaning Tables, the Player gets
“Imprison” and “Representative”.
The Player interprets this to mean that the
enormous rift in space closes as mysteriously as it
appeared, but The Founders captured someone,
or something, associated with it.
“Do I find out what’s going on?” The Player
gives this Question Odds of Nearly Certain,
figuring that since Rick helped the hero team
with the crisis they will clue him in on what
they found.
The Player already established that a
representative of the world beyond the rift had
been captured. To get some idea of what this

## NPC looks like the Player turns to the Character


### Appearance Elements Table, rolling “Strange”

and “Colorful”.
178178 179179

# THE BIG EXAMPLE

The leader of The Founders beckons Rick to
join the team as they gather around something.
Laying on the ground is a strange creature. It
looks like an enormous flying eye, with bright
red, leathery skin.
“It came through the rift,” a member of The
Founders said. “We subdued it right away.”
The Player followed their expectations with
that moment. They could have asked Fate

## Questions to establish more details, or Discovered

Meaning, but at this point they had a pretty good
idea how the Scene was panning out and wanted
to run with their own impressions.

## The Player had earlier established that The

Founders was a superhero team, but now wants
to give them a little more detail by coming up
with some facts about a few of the members. The
Player doesn’t want to take the time to detail
every NPC on the team, but two sounds good.

## Starting with the leader of The Founders, the

Player figures it would be good to know their
main power and their name. Turning to the

### Powers Elements Table, the Player rolls “Others”

and “Emission”. The Player interprets this to
mean that the ability is a powerful eye beam blast.
To give the leader a name the Player rolls on
the Names Elements Table for inspiration, getting
“R” and “Wah”. The Player interprets this into
the name Ra, the hero maintains an Egyptian sun
god motif to accompany his fiery eye blasts.

## For the second member of the team the


### Player rolls again on the Powers Table and gets

“Damage” and “Emotion”. This is interpreted
as a mental power, the ability to control others’
emotions to make them run out of control.

### Rolling on the Names Table, the Player gets

“Fi” and “Ar”. That’s not enough to make an
interpretation so the Player continues rolling and
gets “Oh” and “Ah”. The Player interprets this
into Fear Aura.
There are more members of The Founders, but
that’s enough for now. This seems like a good
place to wrap up the first Scene. The Player writes
a summary on the Adventure Journal, marking
down Scene 1. While there are a lot of unknowns
right now, such as where the rift came from and
will it return, Rapid Red and The Founders
succeeded in minimizing the crisis. The Player is
going to count this as the PC mostly being in
control of the Scene, giving the Chaos Factor a -1
modifier down to 4.
Editing the Adventure Lists, the Player adds
“Why the rift?” on the Threads List. On the

## Characters List goes “The Founders”, “Ra”, “Fear

Aura”, and “Captured Alien”. Thinking about it a
moment, the Player decides to also put down “City”
to account for the people in the city and “The
Blurb” to represent where Rick works in his alter
ego time and the friends he has there who might
become a part of the adventure given the chance.
It’s time for the next Scene. The Player
expects The Founders to take the prisoner back
to their headquarters for questioning. Given the
friendliness Ra showed Rick in the first Scene it
would make sense that the PC would accompany
the hero team.

# THE BIG EXAMPLE

The Chaos Factor is currently at 4. The Player
rolls a d10 to test this Expected Scene idea and
gets a 2, an Interrupt.
Right away the adventure is taking an
unexpected turn.
The Player needs to roll up a Random Event as
inspiration for how this unexpected Scene starts.

### Rolling on the Random Events Focus Table gives

“NPC Action”. To figure out which NPC acts
the Player rolls on the Characters List. There are
6 entries on the List, just barely breaking into
the second section. This means the Player has to
roll two dice, a d4 to determine which section of
the List to roll in and a d10 to determine which
element in that section is selected.
The Player rolls a 3 and a 6. This leads us to
the second section of the Characters List and a
blank line.
When getting a blank line on a List we get the
option to choose an element on the List or to roll
again. The Player thinks it would make the most
sense if the captured alien did something. The
Founders just captured the strange visitor, which
came from another world. Who knows what it’s
capable of or what mayhem it might cause.

### The Player considers which Meaning Table to

roll on for this Random Event. It’s about the alien
doing something, so maybe the Actions Meaning

### Tables. However, it’s a Character doing the action,

so perhaps one of the Character oriented tables.

### They choose the Characters Elements Table.

Rolling, the Player gets “Friend” and “Unexpected”.
These results make the Player reconsider who
the alien is and what it represents.
Back at The Founders headquarters, the alien is
kept in a containment force field. The creature
wakes and, communicating telepathically, tells
them it has come as a friend to help.
The alien saying it is friendly is certainly
unexpected, considering the amount of damage
that accompanied its arrival.
This gives the Player some ideas but before
running with them they want to get more
information from the alien. The Player rolls on
the Character Conversations Elements Table for
inspiration on what the alien says to explain itself.

## The Player rolls “Inform” and “Threatening”.

This gives the Player some interpretations but
nothing they are certain of. The Player tests their
top idea with a Fate Question.
“Does it warn us of an impending invasion
from its home dimension?” That sounds like a
plausible interpretation, the Player assigns it Odds
of Likely. Checking this against the Chaos Factor
of 4 on the Fate Chart gives us a 50% chance of
being true. The Player rolls 26 for a Yes.
Before moving forward with a full interpretation
the Player figures it’s time to give the alien a name.

### Rolling on the Names Elements Table they get

“Ahg” and “Animal”. The Player considers this,
and given that the alien is from another reality the
name should be something that sounds a bit odd.

## The Player comes up with Ogberd.

The alien, who says his name is Ogberd, claims
he traveled to our dimension to warn us of an
impending invasion from his reality. He apologizes
for the abrupt and dangerous arrival, but opening
portals between worlds is messy business and it was
the only way he could get here.
The Player wants to ask the Fate Question
“Do The Founders believe him?” Before
assigning Odds, the Player decides that
Rapid Red does believe Ogberd. Despite the
devastation his traveling to our realm caused his

## Rolling a blank line on the Characters or

Threads List gives us the option of choosing
an element instead of randomly rolling it.
This is an opportunity for you to nudge the
narrative of your adventure in a direction
that seems the most logical or exciting.
However, if you don’t want this control or a
choice isn’t obvious you can instead choose to
roll again to let the dice decide.
180180 181181

# THE BIG EXAMPLE

warning seems plausible. Also, if he’s correct,
they need to act now.
The Player wants this to be a role-playing
moment where the group discusses if they
believe Ogberd’s account. Using the rules of
the RPG the Player is using for this adventure,
SuperBreakers!, Rapid Red makes a Persuasion
Task Roll to convince The Founders to trust the
alien. The roll succeeds.

## The Player decides not to ask the Fate

Question after all, letting the task resolution roll
decide instead.

## Rick and The Founders discuss Ogberd’s claim.

As wild as it sounds, if it’s true, the entire Earth
could be at risk. The rift that disrupted downtown
was evidence enough that powerful forces are at
play. They can’t afford not to trust Ogberd.
Even though The Founders believe, it would
make sense that they try to verify the information
anyway. Since this is The Founders, a famous
group of heroes, and we are at their headquarters,
the Player figures they likely have some high tech
equipment that may help.
The Player poses this as a Fate Question,
asking “Do The Founders have some tech to help
verify Ogberd’s claim?” The Player gives this
Odds of Very Likely.
With the Chaos Factor at 4 and with Odds
of Very Likely, the Fate Chart gives this a 65%
chance of a Yes. The Player rolls 24 for Yes.
The Player considers asking more Questions,
or perhaps Discovering Meaning, to narrow down
what technology they have that would be helpful
but decides that would slow the adventure down
too much right now. The Player instead chooses
to improvise and run with their expectations.
The Founders headquarters is full of amazing
technology that Rick has never seen before. With
Ogberd’s help, a Founder scientist uses a device
to open a channel of communication between
our world and his. Ogberd is able to reach
companions of his there, members of a resistance
opposing the invasion, who confirm the warning
and show The Founders what they are up against.
The Player needs to figure out what they
learned, who is invading, and how?
They start with a Fate Question, “Is this a
warlord of some kind?” The Player assigns Odds
of Nearly Certain. An alternative explanation
could be some kind of natural force or army of
creatures, but so far this all sounds like something
intentionally done by a conqueror. With a Chaos

## Factor of 4 the Fate Chart gives a 75% chance.

The Player rolls 12. This is within the 75, but
such a low roll that it falls within the Exceptional
range of 15 or less. The answer is Exceptional Yes.
So the villain is a warlord and then some. Since
we’re talking about dimensional travel and the
end of worlds, the Player interprets this to mean
that the villain is not only a conqueror from
that other reality but a very powerful being that
182182

# THE BIG EXAMPLE

rules the entire dimension. We are dealing with a
cosmic force.
The Player wants to get a better idea of what
this being is like. Discovering Meaning to
generate details, the Player rolls on the Characters

### Elements Table and gets “Combative” and

“Anxious”. Combative certainly fits into what
we’ve seen so far, and anxious makes it sound like
this ruler is maybe paranoid and power hungry.
To get an idea of what powers this cosmic
being possesses, the Player rolls on the Powers

### Elements Table and gets “Skill” and “Magic”. The

Player interprets this to mean that the being is a
powerful sorcerer with godlike abilities.
To give this being a name the Player rolls on
the Names Table, getting “Or” and “Tal”. The
Player wants more prompts so continues rolling,
getting “Lee” and “Et”. The Player interprets this
into Orta Leet.

## This seems like a good place to end the Scene.

A lot was learned and the adventure has really
taken focus. The Player updates the Adventure
Journal, summarizing this Scene. When adjusting
the Chaos Factor, the Player considers whether
or not Rapid Red was in control. He was
instrumental in convincing The Founders to trust
Ogberd, however learning about the impending
invasion introduced a huge threat that they don’t
have an answer for. The Player decides this means
the PC was less in control, although it’s a close
call. They raise the Chaos Factor to 5.
Editing the Adventure Lists, the Player crosses
out “Why the rift?” on the Threads List. The PC
discovered why the downtown crisis happened so
that goal is solved. They add a new Thread with
“Stop the invasion.”
On the Characters List, the Player updates
“Captured Alien” to “Ogberd”, reflecting
learning his name. Characters that were
important in this Scene included “The Founders”
and “Ogberd” so the Player gives each an
additional entry on the List reflecting their
growing importance to this adventure.
The Player also adds “Orta Leet”, the cosmic
entity and threat they are facing.
Since Ogberd’s companions on the other side
were helpful the Player decides to include them on
the List as well, calling them “Resistance fighters”.
A lot happened in that Scene to change the
focus of the adventure. Rapid Red has to help
The Founders avert a dimensional invasion of
cosmic proportions.
For the next Scene, the Player figures that
if Ogberd took the trouble to travel to our
dimension he had more in mind than just
warning us. He probably has a solution. The

# THE BIG EXAMPLE

it exists, but that sounds like a good basis for the
next Scene.
With the Chaos Factor back at 5, the Player
tests this Expected Scene by rolling a d10 and gets
7. The Expected Scene happens.
So, Ogberd has a plan. The Player decides to
ask a Fate Question to help figure out what he
has in mind. “Is there something here, on Earth,
that will help us fight Orta?” The Player just took
a wild guess with this Question, it was the first
thing that came to mind. They don’t have any
real confidence in it, however, so they assign it
Odds of 50/50. With the Chaos Factor at 5, the
chances of a Yes are 50%. The Player rolls and
Mythic says Yes.
The Player considers asking more Questions to
pinpoint what this weapon is but instead decides
to Discover Meaning by rolling on the Actions

### Meaning Tables. Maybe finding out what this

thing does will help define what it is. The Player
rolls “Praise” and “Hope”.
The Player has to think about this one, and
decides to stretch the literal meaning of those
words to reach an interpretation.
Since Orta is a mystical being, the word “Praise”
almost sounds magical. “Hope” in this Context
could be protection or a way to banish Orta.

## The Players goes with this interpretation:


## Ogberd tells The Founders that he traveled to

Earth to warn us, but also to find a long lost
book of magic that contains a spell to banish
Orta Leet from our dimension and from his. The
book was brought here long ago by evil acolytes of
Orta as a way to hide the tome from those who
would seek to end her despotic rule.
This brings a new mission for Rapid Red, to
recover the book. The Player asks, “Does Ogberd
know where the book is?” The Player gives this
Odds of Likely. The Fate Chart says this has a
65% chance, and the roll comes back a Yes.
To figure out where the book is, the Player rolls
on the Locations Elements Meaning Table for
inspiration and gets “Confusing” and “Unpleasant”.

## Ogberd says he knows where the book is, sort of.

It was ensconced in a graveyard in France several
centuries ago. He’s not sure what graveyard,
however, or where in the graveyard it is.
This is going to require some detective work to
locate the book, but Rapid has a solid lead at least.
184184


---

# THE BIG EXAMPLE

The Player knows that their PC is going to go
after the book, and figures Ogberd will go with
him. They’re not sure if any of The Founders will
go so the Player turns it into a Fate Question:
“Do any of The Founders accompany Rapid?”

## Considering how important this mission is the

Player gives this Odds of Nearly Certain, an 85%
chance.
However, the Player rolls a 92 for a No. The

## Player makes this interpretation:


## Rapid prepares for the journey to Europe with

Ogberd, expecting members of The Founders
to go with him. He’s excited to work with the
famous team! However, he’s surprised when they
tell him that he and the visitor from another
world will be handling this mission alone.
Ra has decided that he thinks searching for the
spellbook is an uncertain solution. He and the
team are going to focus on preparing defenses
against the invasion and contacting heroes and
governments across the world to get ready.
It’s in Rapid’s hands now to maybe save the
world, assuming that Ogberd is correct about
the spell.
The Player decides this is a good spot to end
the Scene. This Scene was mostly information,
answering questions about the looming crisis and
deciding what to do next.
The Player updates the Adventure Journal with
a Scene 3 summary. Since this Scene involved
coming up with a plan of action to stop Orta, a
plan that Rapid is centrally involved in, the Player
decides that their PC was in control of this Scene
and lowers the Chaos Factor to 4.
The Player updates the Threads List by adding
another line for “Stop the invasion”, since that
was a big part of this Scene, and also adds “Find
the book”.
On the Characters List, the Player adds another
line for “Ogberd” since the planning in this Scene
mostly revolved around him. That’s Ogberd’s
third appearance on the Characters List, which
means he is maxed out and won’t get any more
listings from future Scenes.
The Player considers adding another instance
of “The Founders” but they didn’t play a big
role in this Scene. The Player decides not to add
another listing for them.
Rapid Red’s adventure continues as he and
the visitor from another world travel to France in
order to find a spell to save the world from their
magical foe.

Choose a method for how to decide when a Scene
begins and ends.
  INTER EST: This is the default approach.
A Scene starts with something interesting
happening and ends when that interest is
concluded.
  TIME OR LOCATION:  Scenes end when
there is a change in time or location.
  NARRATIVE SHIFT:  A Scene ends
when there is a shift in the narrative of your
adventure, with the next Scene picking up with
that narrative change.
  MOOD: Scenes end when you feel they have
run out of steam and it’s time to start a new one.
  AUTOMATIC INTERRUPT:  Choose to
have a Scene begin as an Interrupt without
testing it against the Chaos Factor.

## Discovering Meaning

Create details without using Fate Questions by
rolling for a word pair on a Meaning Table of
your choice. Interpret the results.

## Generating NPC Behavior

  EXPECTATIONS:  If you have a clear idea
what the NPC will do or say, and the action
isn’t crucial to the adventure, then follow
your expectations for their action instead of
choosing randomly.
  NO IDEA:  If you have no expectation for
what an NPC will do then roll a word pair on a

### Meaning Table of your choice for inspiration.

  EXPECTATION AND CRUCIAL:  If you
have an idea of what the NPC will do, and the
action is important to your adventure, then
frame the action as a Fate Question.

## End Of Scene Bookkeeping

  EDIT LIST ELEMENTS:  Add new Threads
and NPCs that were important in the Scene
to the Threads and Characters Lists. For
Threads and Characters that were already on
the List, add another entry for them if they
were important in the Scene up to a maximum
of three on the List. Remove Threads and
Characters from the Lists that are no longer
relevant to the adventure.
  ADJUST THE CHAOS FACTOR:  If the

## Player Character was mostly in control of the


## Scene then apply a -1 modifier to the Chaos

Factor, to a minimum of 1. If the Player

## Character was mostly not in control during the


## Scene then apply a +1 modifier to the Chaos

Factor to a maximum of 9.

## Determine NPC Statistics

  EXPECTED STATISTIC VALUE:  Decide
what you think the value of an NPC statistic
should be.
  ASK A FATE QUESTION:  Ask the Fate
Question “Does the NPC have a statistic of
this value?” Assign the Question Odds and
resolve it.
  INTERPRET:  Interpret the results of the Fate
Question. As a guide:
 - Y es: The value you expected.
 -  E xceptional Yes: The value is about
25% higher.
 - N o: The value is about 25% lower.
 -  E xceptional No: The value is about
50% lower.
 -  R andom Event: Generate a Random
Event as a special condition associated
with this statistic.

# RULES SUMMARY


## Thread Progress Track

Use a Thread Progress Track to keep an adventure
focused on a particular Thread.
  FOCUS THREAD:  Choose a Thread to be
the Focus Thread of the Progress Track.
  CHOOSE A TRACK:  Choose which Track to
use, depending on how long you want it to take
to resolve the Thread. The choices are 10, 15,
or 20 point Tracks.
  PROGRESS:  Making any Progress toward
resolving the Focus Thread in a Scene awards 2

## Progress Points that are marked on the Track.

  FL ASHPOINT: An especially important and
dramatic event happens in a Scene related to
the Focus Thread. Award 2 Progress Points and
mark the “Did A Flashpoint Happen?” box.
  TRACK FLASHPOINT:  If you reach enough
Points on the Track to trigger a Flashpoint, and
one hasn’t already occurred in that phase of the
Track, then a Flashpoint event happens. Treat
this as a Random Event with an automatic

## Event Focus of Current Context.

  DISCOVERY CHECK:  Make a Discovery
Check when forward momentum has stalled
and you are out of ideas for how to proceed.
Ask the Fate Question “Is something
discovered?” Assign the Question Odds of no
less than 50/50.
 -  Y es: Roll on the Thread Discovery

### Check Table.

 -  N o: Nothing useful is found.
 -  E xceptional Yes: Roll twice on the

### Thread Discovery Check Table.

 -  E xceptional No: Nothing useful is found
and you cannot make another Discovery

## Check during the rest of this Scene.

  PLOT ARMOR:  The Focus Thread cannot be
resolved through normal Mythic play as long as
the Thread Progress Track is still in progress.
Any adventure results that would complete or
end the Thread must be interpreted in a way to
keep the Thread active.
  CONCLUSION: When the Progress Track
is completed the Conclusion is triggered.

## Generate a Random Event with an automatic


## Event Focus of Current Context, with the

Context revolving around creating an Event
that can resolve and end the Thread Focus. If
it makes more sense, you can choose to delay
generating the Conclusion until the next Scene.
Keyed Scenes
Create special situations to trigger specific events
in your adventure.
  KEYED SCENE TRIGGER:  Decide what

## Triggers the Keyed Scene Event.

  KEYED SCENE EVENT:  Decide what
happens when the Trigger occurs. The Event
happens at the beginning of the next Scene.

## Using Mythic With


## Prepared Adventures

  SCALING:  Decide on a scaling factor for
your Player Character in relation to the
adventure. Roughly, how powerful are they in
comparison to what the adventure is designed
for? Represent this comparison with a single
number that becomes the Diminisher Value.
For instance, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, etc.
  APPLY DIMINISHER:  Apply the
Diminisher Value to all challenges met in the
adventure, reducing the number of encounters,
NPC statistics, and other values that challenge
your Player Character.
  READ INTRO:  Read introductory portions
of the prepared adventure.

# RULES SUMMARY

  PREPARE LISTS:  Include any relevant
Threads or NPCs onto your Lists that seem
important from the adventure introduction.
  ADVENTURE FEATURES:  Create a third
List, Adventure Features, and include on it
anything special about the prepared adventure
that you think should be on the List.
  FIRST SCENE:  Create a first Scene based off
of how the prepared adventure suggests starting.
  PLAY SCENE BY SCENE:  Play through the
adventure Scene by Scene, as you would with a
normal Mythic adventure, using the content of
the prepared adventure as Context.
  TESTING EXPECTED SCENES:  Test
Scenes as normal, however instead of using
Altered and Interrupt Scenes, whenever you roll
equal to or less than the Chaos Factor you still
have the Expected Scene but it also starts with
a Random Event.
  ENCOUNTERS AND LOCATIONS:
When reading new sections of the prepared
adventure, read as little as possible before
deciding Player Character actions.
  ASK FATE QUESTIONS:  Use Fate
Questions to decide the details and outcomes
of encounters when there is doubt.
  RANDOM EVENTS: Use the Prepared

### Adventure Event Focus Table instead of the

regular Random Event Focus Table.
Peril Points

## Use Peril Points to change the narrative.

  DECIDE QUANTITY:  Choose how many
Peril Points your Player Character gets. The
default number is 2.
  DECIDE IF THEY REPLENISH:  Choose
if Peril Points reset to the quantity you chose at
the start of each adventuring session, or if they
are a one-time resource that does not replenish.
  EXPEND PERIL POINTS:  Use a Peril Point
to avert an outcome that would otherwise end
the adventure or an important narrative.
Mythic With The

## Adventure Crafter

  FIRST SCENE:  Generate a Turning Point or
two for inspiration for the first Scene.
  INTERRUPT SCENES:  Replace Random

## Events with Turning Points to generate

Interrupt Scenes.
  LISTS: Use Mythic’s List system instead
of The Adventure Crafter’s Lists method.

## References to Plotlines are considered Threads.

When rolling on a List for a Plot Point roll on
the full List, not just the sections that have
elements in them.
      CHOOSE ...: When rolling an empty line on
a List for a Plot Point you have the additional
choice of Add A Thread or Add A Character.

## If you Choose to select a Character on the

Characters List, you can include the Player
Character as an option even though they aren’t
on the List.

PLAYER VS. PC KNOWLEDGE


---

# STRATEGY SOLUTION

TEST IT, ASK IT,
THEN IT’S REAL
PC checks for discovery
before asking a Fate
Question if it exists.
RELIABLE VS.


---

# UNRELIABLE


---

# INFORMATION

Player knowledge is not
official adventure canon
until the PC discovers it,
allowing for the chance
for it to be wrong.


---

# GOING WITH IT

Embracing Player knowledge
from a cinematic, big-
picture view. Prioritize
enjoying the totality of the
adventure over surprises.
EXTRA


---

# KNOWLEDGE


---

# AS AN RP


---

# OPPORTUNITY

Player knowledge triggers
an opportunity for the
PC to earn it, “gamifying”
the knowledge gap.

# USING THE ADVENTURE

# ADVENTURE


---

# ELEMENT RULES


---

# FIRST SCENE

Create a first Scene by
generating at least one
Turning Point. Interpret
this into an opening Scene,
perhaps using some of
the details as background.
Add any NPCs and Threads
generated onto the Lists.


---

# INTERRUPT


---

# SCENES


## Instead of generating a Random

Event to define an Interrupt,
make a Turning Point.
LISTS
 » Use Mythic Lists instead of
Adventure Crafter Lists.
 » Add Threads and Characters
to their Lists as they are
generated in Turning Points.
 » When rolling on a List for
a Thread or Character
Invoked by a Plot Point,
roll on the full List, not
just the sections that
have elements in them.
 » Rolling an empty line
on a List for a Plot Point
gives you an additional
Choice: Add a New Thread
or Add A New NPC.
 » Only Non-Player Characters
go on the Characters List,
not Player Characters.
 » When Choosing an element
on the Characters List you
can always Choose a Player
Character even though
they are not on the List.
